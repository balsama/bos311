I work for Inbound Real Estate. Our snow removal company went out last night/this morning to do the snow removal due to the storm. This morning what they noticed is that it seems the neighbors have been using the right portion of our land as their snow dumping from their cars/sidewalk. The lot next to 15 Rowell is an empty lot and it seems that area is covered with snow and that the snow has overflowed onto our property. Our snow removal was unable to remove it due to not have heavy equipment (bobcat). If someone from the city could come to property and remove the excess snow, I would greatly appreciate it. Feel free to give me a call @ 617-863-0896.
