Then when I try to cross the street, going from right in front of the Lapels dry cleaners to the T stop, there's no cleared walkway.  I either have to jump over the snowbank, or follow where previous people have already stepped, and hope I won't slip.  Yesterday (Friday, February 10th), the uncleared snow was slushy.  It could very well freeze over soon, making it dangerous to step on.

It was never shoveled/plowed and is merely a beaten down path from people walking.  This never gets plowed by the City... It is City property.. In past years the only time it gets done is if I or someone else complains to the City.  I walk from One Financial home often and have for years....and EVERY sidewalk is perfect all the time except this one!  The City plows the sidewalks at Waterfront park just about 200 yards away so all they have to do is go down the sidewalk a little and do it.
