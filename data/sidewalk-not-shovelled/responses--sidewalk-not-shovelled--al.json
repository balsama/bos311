Unless you are a strong healthy young adult wearing ice climbing crampons it's very difficult to walk even a block in 'America's walking city'.  Look Marty, we've had one snowstorm with only about 4 inches of snow. Already anyone in a wheelchair or pushing a stroller has to use the street.  What can we expect when we get a real snowstorm?  Marty, we both live in Dorchester. Take a walk around the block from Butler St.   I think you'll find that the current policies could be improved.  Maybe this means stronger disincentives for not clearing the sidewalk in front of your property?  Or maybe requiring owners to clear the sidewalk of adjacent properties also to create overlapping coverage?  Or maybe city crews clear unsafe sidewalks and send the property owner the bill?  After you recover from that nasty fall, we should sit down and work out a better strategy.
