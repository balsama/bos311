Saturday, I cleared a 3-foot high path around my home so everyone can pass as instructed. To do so without shoveling snow into the street I had to shovel it over my fence and on the right-side of the sidewalk. It took me hours to do so and I had to change my gloves and coat twice. Later that night a plow (Mas Lic M64 728) came by on Dakota Street and assisted two drivers that parked in front of my house to clear up their parking spots. (These drivers do not live in this house.) During the clean up the path I created on Dakota Street was blocked in several places. Then when I tried to exit my home from its only unblocked entrance\\exit (direct path from my steps to Dakota Street sidewalk) it was also plowed in and I had to shovel it for the third time to get out. With this parking spot cleared in front of my gate cars are starting to park here which makes me surrounded on all sides. Sunday, a plow (Mass Lic M11 579) came to clear up Claybourne Street. It began at the intersection of Claybourne\\Dakota and headed toward Bowdoin Street. A good set of this snow came from people clearing around their cars. They shoveled and the plow moved it. Snow was brought from more than half-way down the street and piled on my side at the intersection of Claybourne and Dakota Streets. This effectively blocked off the path I had cleared from my entrance to\\on Claybourne Street. Now tonight the driver of a white 4-door Dodge minivan Mass license plate 269 NS9 has blocked the path from my door to the street a spot he\\she you did not dig out? Couldn\u2019t he\\she have backup so we can enter and exit? Is my 69 year old mother expected to climb over these snow piles with her cane to get out of her own home? Heaven forbid that I call an ambulance to come for her and there is a delay in her receiving treatment because they cannot easily get to her. I should not have to shovel out my entrance every time I need to enter or exit and then have to take pills to relieve my arthritis flare-ups","requested_datetime":"2013-02-12T01:41:51-05:00","updated_datetime":"2013-02-19T15:49:27-05:00","address":"23 Claybourne St, Dorchester, MA, 02124","lat":42.2987800004227,"long":-71.07242000017328},

Living on this bus route, after snowstorms we expect to have to shovel out \u2013 again \u2013 the handicapped street egress after the plows have come by again. But sometime last night, these contractors plowed again, and this time they plowed the street snow ONTO my already shoveled sidewalk at the corner of LaGrange St. and LaSalle St (703 LaGrange St.). I am an 82 year old \u201cfrail\u201d female veteran who has lived at this address since 1942 (seeing plenty of snowstorms and snow plows here!), and this is the first time I have ever had snow piled like this onto my sidewalks. It is also the first time I\u2019ve ever thought to register a formal complaint to the city of Boston. Both I and my medically disabled daughter shoveled as much snow as possible, but because of the severity of the storm we had to hire someone to snow-blow the sidewalks (LaGrange & LaSalle Sts) and the handicapped plate/street egress (in compliance with city regulations). This cost me $100, but as of last night, my sidewalks and street egress was cleared and clean. Now, since these contractors plowed the street snow onto my sidewalks, there is 4 \u2013 6 foot high HARD, PACKED, HEAVY BLOCKS of snow obliterating my newly-snowblown sidewalk and street egress. I am not physically or financially able to remove this MBTA contractor-induced blockade of snow, which now completely inhibits and blocks ANY pedestrian travel, and blocks the handicap access grip plate. The \u2018Baker & Vermont\u2019 bus stop is right across the street. I am letting you know that I will not be responsible for any \u2018fines\u2019 as I HAVE ALREADY done my job to comply with regulations regarding snow removal, and the dumping of so much street snow onto my (or ANY) sidewalks is totally unacceptable.

Neither have been shoveled. The sidewalk perimeter of SW Corridor Park, along Call Street, down McBride, and over to Boynton has not been shoveled. | Details: I have called several times about this. There are MANY unshoveled areas in my neighborhood in JP. As it is, I cannot walk my dog around the block without walking on the road for at least half the time. This morning, my 17 month old and I slipped on the ice. Luckily, we were not majorly injured, but we easily could have been. When I called the Mayor's hotline, the person on the other end cut me off, corrected my word choice, and told me the city is not responsible. Maybe you don't care if two of your residents are walking in the streets due to the negligence I described. I understand that there are many sidewalks to clear and that the city has been working hard. Still, at the very least, I would hope that you would care about the 500 or more English HS students who need to use these sidewalks to get to school today. The sidewalks bordering English High and SW Corridor Park, which include Call St, McBride, and Boynton, have not been shoveled. The paths between Forest Hills and English HS are extremely icy. It would be nice if you would attend to this matter. It would also be nice if when I called the city to talk about it, I was treated with kindness and interest. I feel like the person was angry that I called and wanted me to know it was the state's or someone else's problem. Regardless of who owns SW Corridor Park and the vacant lots in the city, at the end of the day, I would expect that the city would at least care about it. I am truly disappointed in the service I received on the phone and in the state of the sidewalks around my neighborhood.","requested_datetime":"2013-02-13T09:08:27-05:00","updated_datetime":"2013-02-17T11:23:46-05:00","address":"1 City Hall Plz, Boston, MA, 02114","lat":42.36041999995471,"long":-71.0582740001165},
