I have just arrived as a new tenant on 3/2/2015, and the citation was written 3/3/2015. I cleared it yesterday, as soon as I was aware of the requirement, and will strive to keep it clear in the future. I am a US Army Reserve Officer, newly arrived in Boston to fill a DA Civilian position with the ROTC program. I assure you that shoveling snow has not been an issue that came to my attention in FL, where I just arrived from. Is it reasonable to request that the fine be waived this one time? I was surprised, at 50 years old, that I outlasted the shovel, and I will need to purchase a new one after clearing the snow. Your Officer (#008) was absolutely correct that no one had made any effort to clear the snow previously, so it was the full pile that needed to be tackled. I have just read the requirements today, and I will need to put some more effort in, tonight, to reach the 42\" width. Please be assured, that as a Veteran with 32 years and counting in uniform, I am sworn to contribute more to society than I cost. I would simply like to recall my welcome to Boston differently than a $50 fine.
