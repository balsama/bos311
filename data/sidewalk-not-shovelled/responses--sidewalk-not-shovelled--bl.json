These lots are many lots containing the railroad that runs alongside the Haul Road from South Boston up into Fan Pier.] Details:  [In some of the heavier storms this winter, Boston issued fines to property owners not shoveling sidewalks.  Our property spends thousands of dollars each winter to comply with Boston Regs on snow/ice removal.  Before the winter, the lots up and down the the Haul Road throughout South Boston were bought by Mass Transit Authority, and none of these lots were shoveled or treated during any storm throughout the entire winter.  Despite our buildings paying for lots of snow removal, I would walk out the front door and almost immediately have to walk onto the street because the property owned by Mass Transit was always covered in snow.  On W. 4th St, where I walk through toward the T, there's also a City Bridge and property behind the Police Station, none of which is ever shoveled.  So, the City of Boston is issuing fines to people for not shoveling, but the City and State authorities are not even shoveling their own property.  This requires residents (who not only pay to have their private property shoveled, but who also pay hefty taxes for the City to take care of its own snow removal) to walk in street in unsafe conditions.  Could this situation be brought to light with those in the City and Mass Transit, to see what they intend to do for shoveling their property?  \n\nThanks]   Exact location:  [All sidewalks adjacent to all lots recently acquired by Mass Transit Authority.
