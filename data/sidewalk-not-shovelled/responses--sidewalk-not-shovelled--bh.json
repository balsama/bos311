This is unacceptable! This is been going on for at least the last two years that that sidewalk on that corner is not taken care of. The other four corners at Boylston and chars Charles Street or taken care of but not that southeast corner. Someone shovels the walk that's up close to the storefronts but that doesn't help anyone actually get onto the sidewalk when they cross the street.

In addition, they do not go the entire length of their property line past Lila Road. They stop removing snow where their cast iron fence ends, and neglect the rest of the sidewalk in front of their chain link fence. Worse, even where they do clear, they do not lay out sand or salt. This is a slippery hill and my wife, who does not drive, relies on it to get to public transportation. My children attend BPS schools, and they are required to walk down this hill to catch their bus on Centre Street.

The building should be FINED. The law requires building owners to pile snow on their own property not into public spaces/roadways. Additionally, my comments from the conversation I had with the Marlborough St homeowner are that the plowing company pushes snow into the alley, then proceeds to plow the alleyway pushing snow furhter into the parking spots behind the buildings on the opposite side of the alley. This adds to the snow that they must then remove in order to clear their parking spaces.","requested_datetime":"2015-01-26T12:26:38-05:00","updated_datetime":"2015-01-27T08:38:43-05:00","address":"109 111 Commonwealth Ave, Boston","lat":42.352700000227514,"long":-71.07687999982768},

This takes just a little thinking and consideration. Ironic that the city can impose snow shoveling rules and fines on residents yet residents have no recourse but this web-site!

What's more, the sidewalk that cuts between the construction area (on Brookline Ave) is the ONLY pedestrian crossway in the area. It's extremely important that these sidewalks are shoveled as the ongoing construction and traffic (drivers are always speeding through the lights) makes this area already dangerous to pedestrians. Needing to navigate unshoveled sidewalks only makes the area more dangerous. Please see that whoever is in charge of this project keeps the sidewalks clear. Thank you !","requested_datetime":"2015-01-25T11:29:32-05:00","updated_datetime":"2015-01-25T11:29:31-05:00","address":"1390 Boylston St, Boston","lat":42.34326027803341,"long":-71.102315168894,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/54c519d16963753f0d6c486b/report.jpg"},
