I know all the work the snow removal contractors have to do and they are doing a great job, my complaint is both sides of Bennington Street East Boston and Beachmont, Revere. Not sure who takes care of this. I have live here about 20 years and neither side is hardly ever shoveled. There are many people who use the sidewalks back and forth and even visit the Belle Isle Park with their children and dogs. The Park is always taken care of but not the sidewalks. Just today I walked to Beachmont to the store and had to walk in the street both ways, felt a breeze as the vehicles zip by me doing over 30mph of course. I admit just the other day the other side opposite the park was shoveled, and I was very surprised, but most times it never is. In the Summer I complained about all the trees and bushes overlapping onto the sidewalk making it hard to walk by without being scratched, but that was taken care of. Even though we do not own the sidewalks, homeowners have to shovel in front of their houses. I hope that you will see that both sides of this street will be shoveled especially after today?s snowfall. I will be requesting the same to Mayor Rizzo.
