I have taken great care to ensure that the sidewalks around the perimeter of my property are completely shoveled and passable after each storm. Needless to say, I find it extremely frustrating when snow plows and the very large snow removal equipment is continuously dumping snow back onto the sidewalks that I have cleared. It is particularly a nuisance at the corner (Romsey & Dorchester Ave) where they are dumping massive mountains of snow that are rock solid and virtually impossible to shovel by hand or with a snow blower. I do understand that the events of the last couple of weeks are unprecedented in our city and I respect all of the efforts that are in progress to remove the snow. However, it would be nice if the plow drivers and operators of this heavy equipment could be a little more respectful and try not to snow in walkways that have been previously cleared!!! It's really frustrating.

Once on the other side (corner of Howes and Pleasant) the entire corner was not even shoveled. Just trampled, deep snow. (Residential sidewalk). There is also another home on Howes where the sidewalk has not been cleared. Making it difficult to get my younger child to his bus stop without walking in the street. With regards to the curbs. On the way to to school, we were blocked at Willis/Pleasant and again at Pond/Edison Green. In both cases, walking on the opposite side of the street was not an option due to un-shoveled sidewalks. Perhaps when crews are in the area removing some of the bigger mounds, they can also work to cut an opening in the huge mounds blocking the curb ramps and forcing kids to walk in the street with traffic.
