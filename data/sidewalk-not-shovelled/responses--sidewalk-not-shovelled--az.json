Because a car was not parked there, people in the neighborhood deposit their snow from their walks and cars from all of the storms, in front of my house- this has created a snow mountain that now measures 30 feet long by 20 feet high by 20 feet wide, and growing as I write this. This poses several safety issues involving my family and tenants and the neighborhood children. We cannot pull out of the driveway safely, the mountain has infringed on my sidewalk, and most worrisome is that neighborhood children are playing on it. My fear is that they will slide out into the street and get hit by a truck/car or that they will fall through the mountain and literally be buried alive.
