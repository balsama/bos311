This is a complaint about the snow plow process. Throughout the storm yesterday, snow plows continually pushed snow from the street onto adjacent sidewalks, making snow removal on the sidewalks incredibly difficult. I spent 3 hours removing snow from the sidewalk next to my property, and when I came back outside one hour later the sidewalk was covered in a foot of slushy snow that was pushed there by the snow plow. How can you expect home owners to shovel the two feet of snow that fell on their sidewalks and then shovel the foot (or more) of snow that was put there by the plow? We're essentially doing the plow's job by shoveling the street snow onto our yard. Many people in my neighborhood didn't bother shoveling their sidewalk because of this and I don't blame them. Dumping snow onto personal property is surely against regulation, no matter who does it. Please fix this.","requested_datetime":"2015-01-28T12:40:54-05:00","updated_datetime":"2015-01-31T10:41:02-05:00","address":"Intersection Of Bourne St & Catherine St, Roslindale","lat":42.288803800552294,"long":-71.1130265856003},

This morning someone (a plow) had pushed all the snow from the street onto the handicapped corner making it unpassable. I then re-shoveled a path for people to walk in. I do not want to be responsible for snow I cannot remove and removed twice when someone with a plow carelessly made the roadway larger and plowed a \"mountain\" of snow onto my sidewalk corner. I cannot remove it. I have a back injury and should not be shoveling at all. I do not want to receive a citation because the handicapped ramp is not shoveled. I CAN\"T DO IT - ONCE never mind TWICE. Also yesterday a neighbor who owns 2 houses and is a policeman at Station 7 in East Boston was telling his tenants it was OK to throw snow into the street. They proceeded to clean off their car and throw large amounts of snow into the middle of Cottage Street. Does a homeowner who is a police officer have the right to make up his own rules about snow removal to keep his tenants happy. This is downright unfair. I pay taxes - he is not the mayor of my street or of Boston and has no right to make his own rules. He owns 16 - 18 Cottage Street. He does not live there. He gets along with no neighbors - his sidewalk looks like it is in Florida. No trace of snow - all of it was blown into the middle of Cottage Street to make the roadway inpassable. | Exact location: corner","requested_datetime":"2015-01-28T15:18:59-05:00","updated_datetime":"2015-01-29T15:26:19-05:00","address":"123 Webster St, East Boston","lat":42.36622999978474,"long":-71.036270000234},
