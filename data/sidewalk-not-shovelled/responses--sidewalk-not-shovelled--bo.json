The first night of the snow storm in the middle of the night they plowed Ryder Hill and put the snow along the side of my house as well as making a hill in the corner. I didn't mind figuring that I'd do my part. Then came yesterday. The backhoe was plowing Brayton Rd and backing down to my house and putting it again on the side of my hse. I asked the driver not to put all of it in my yard and he was good about it. Then they came and plowed Ryder Hill and again they started to put it in my yard and again I asked the driver to find other places. He was very belligerent and disrespectful. He left. Today I came home to find Ryder Hill again plowed and all the snow, ice, salt 20 feet into my yard and the height at least 20 feet on top of my wall, shrubs, and various expensive plantings. He also completely buried the storm drain which is causing flooding of our street. I've lived here my whole life and have never seen anything like it. I have driven throughout the city today and have not seen it anywhere else. Can you help? Is there a way I can get the company Ciccone to come out and remove it?

However, they have only done part of the job. In addition to that section, they have piled the snow at corner of that \"triangle\" and are using the corner in front of Symphony Hall (St. Stephen & Mass AVe.) as another dumping spot. The piles are more than 6 feet high. The BSO has two large parking lots that are down to bare pavement. They also have riding sidewalk snowplows and can easily move the snow to the parking lots and make it easier for pedestrians and cars to move safely through those intersections. They are currently busy removing snow from the \"No parking/towing\" area on St. Stephen that is next to the BSO.
