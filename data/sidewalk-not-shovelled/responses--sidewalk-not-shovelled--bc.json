As you might know, the Gardner Pilot Academy is on Athol St and my son attends school there. This corner is on our walking path to school and fortunately a car stopped for us this morning so that we could access the Athol St sidewalk. However, when we reached the end of the property on Athol St, the sidewalk was completely blocked by two garbage cans - a side-effect of inadequate sidewalk shoveling. I moved the cans out of the way, which prompted one of his tenants to open his door and tell me I'd blocked his driveway and to yell \"F*** you!\" - in front of my 10 year-old son on his way to school. I've called Mr. Fisher this morning and let him know that his current shoveling is unacceptable and I expect the corner to be shoveled today. He has verbally promised to get it done - but I'd like to see ISD enforce Boston City code 16-12.16 and ticket Mr. Fisher's property. | Exact location: front","requested_datetime":"2015-02-10T09:54:51-05:00","updated_datetime":"2015-02-11T19:06:05-05:00","address":"17 Raymond St, Allston","lat":42.361523999551885,"long":-71.13442500037289},
