If JP is being included and if this current snow storm qualifies as a snow storm, when the storm is over could someone shovel out my car (2011 Navy Blue Subaru Sedan 625JS6)? On top of my usual situation of being a widow and a senior citizen with many health issues, I now have a torn rotator cuff in my right shouder and there is no way I can shovel even a small amount of snow. In Jamaica Plain, it is not currently a small amount of snow, it has become quite sizable and the storm is not over yet. Would someone let me know if I am part of this group yet. If I am not, I will try and find someone in my neighborhood that can hopefully help me. Thanks, Marilyn Bravo \nThe user entered the address: 14 John A.
