Gridley locks over the Charles River were/are closed this morning. This forces pedestrian traffic (attempting to go from Charlestown to the West End) to backtrack through Paul Revere Park and up the stairs (next to the playground abutting the Charlestown Bridge). The stairs going from ground level at the Paul Revere Park playground up to the west-side sidewalk on the Charlestown Bridge are absolutely caked in ice, and have never been cleared by the state/city. I had to climb up them strictly using my arms on the handrail. There is absolutely no flat spot to even place your foot. I'm a younger guy, but there is no chance an older person could even begin to make this ascent up the stairs. Please open the locks or clear these stairs today before someone hurts themselves. I voted for Mr. Walsh. Please earn my next vote.
