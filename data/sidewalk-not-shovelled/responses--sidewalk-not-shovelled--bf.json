For much of the day, hardly any cars were parked on the street and it could have been cleaned up really nicely. Other nearby side streets have been clear enough to see the blacktop, but ours has been a dangerous place to walk or drive. Unfortunately, this end of the street often seems to be forgotten during storms. Taking into account the volume of traffic that we get from construction trucks and heavy equipment traveling to and from Providence St., our street needs a bit more attention than it\u2019s getting.
