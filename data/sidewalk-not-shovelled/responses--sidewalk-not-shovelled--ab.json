So - now the ice has melted because it has been all day since I called in the report. \n\nI hurt myself and I also have 2 additional pictures of the mess they left on the sidewalk. If I can upload them I will or I'll start 2 new complaints with the additional pictures. \n\nNo one has been by, so the ice has naturally melted today. So when they come by they won't see any ice and they'll move on. \n\nBut - I fell on their ice and hurt myself and went to the doctor today so this is all documented. And I don't understand why they haven't been by all day. \n\nSo - here's the picture - I will be looking out the window to look for a ticket left on their door. If I don't see one I will start calling & escalating within City Hall.
