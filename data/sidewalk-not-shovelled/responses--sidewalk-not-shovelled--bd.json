They have not been sufficiently salting or making a smoooth surface with traction. Furthermore, large, dangerous icicles are forming that could fall at any minute.

Residents have cleaned sidewalks but Boston has left major piles of snow in the street blocking access to sidewalks. It is the negligence of the city of Boston that is putting people in jeopardy because sidewalk ramps and the street in front of sidewalk ramps have not been cleared all along Dartmouth street. I have attached a photo from the corner of East Brookline st. and Harrison Ave as an example of what pedestrians are trying to cross. The city has created a huge pile of snow blocking the sidewalk ramps along the route including the corner of Dartmouth and Tremont. This results in pedestrians having to walk into the street against oncoming traffic to access the sidewalk. The city should not ask residents to clean sidewalks and then create a monster snow pile blocking pedestrians' access to these sidewalks. Here is a quick video clip I recorded from this corner illustrating the danger pedestrians face accessing sidewalks on this corner. Please watch this and consider the risk to pedestrians. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIKn5taKWFo I urge you to reach out to City hall and ask them to kindly clear the path for the 100's of commuters that exit Back Bay station and travel along this route before somebody is hit by a car or injured in a fall.
