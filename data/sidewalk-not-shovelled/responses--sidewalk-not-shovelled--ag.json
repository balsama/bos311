I am not contacting you to dun ourselves. Our tenant and I spent a fair amount of time on Sunday making certain our entire sidewalk, from curb to front fence alongside sidwalk, was clean to the cement. This required not only shoveling but repeated applications of ice-melt (two large bags total) and scraping, in order to have the sidewalk clean by the time the temperature plummeted on Sunday night. Yesterday, I noticed someone had dug out their vehicle parked along our sidewalk and thrown the snow on the sidewalk, covering perhaps a third or so of it from the curb over. I determined (from someone who lives downstairs from him) that the culprit was Ryan Poulo, 26 Oakview Terrace, upstairs unit, who is a medical student at Tufts. I spoke to him about what he had done last night and, while he seemed amused that this would be of concern to me, said he would clean the sidewalk this morning. As of this sending, his vehicle is gone but the sidewalk remains pretty much the same. He may have taken a swipe or two at it but did not return it to the state it was in prior to his dumping snow on it. I request that you fine him the amount you deem appropriate and stipulate that he remove the snow from our front walk properly. | Exact location: front","requested_datetime":"2019-01-23T07:57:14-05:00","updated_datetime":"2019-01-23T12:07:05-05:00","address":"33 Oakview Ter, Jamaica Plain","lat":42.31926000019585,"long":-71.1098600002388},
