It is impossible to use the sidewalks, and so pedestrians have been using the street. The street is a one-way and is so narrow that when a car and two pedestrians cross paths, they can't all fit. It has been like this through all of February. The sidewalks that line the park on Park Dr have been cleared, but the agency that cleared them was too lazy to proceed down Agassiz and onto The Fenway. The Fenway is a dangerous 2-lane road that curves and visibility for moving vehicles at the intersection of The Fenway and Agassiz is frightening for pedestrians because we must cross the street where the pedestrian sign no longer works, and we must hope that oncoming traffic sees us. On top of this, now we are forced to walk in streets which are already compromised by snow banks that have reduced visibility and narrowed the street. I believe this is city property, but I am not sure. I am even more furious believing that it might be, because so far the city has done a terrible job taking care of city property. I will submit these complaints via the web, app, and by calling, each day until I see the sidewalks cleared. I hope it will be taken care of immediately.

This is a side walk that hundreds of people use everyday to access the Orange Line. It is never adequately cleared and it is dangerous. People are falling while trying to cross this mound of snow. Others are walking in the street with the risk of being hit by oncoming traffic. I have complained to the Mayor's office. My neighbors have also sent in complaints. Please address this issue on our behalf. We all shovel our properties or help our landlord's shovel. I do not understand why the residents of these condo complexes fail to do their part.

I have spoken to the station repeatedly about the unsafe conditions. The gas station does not clear any of the sidewalks in Boylston street except for driveway access for cars. This forces pedestrians into the danger of walking in the street where there is already significant traffic and poor visibility. I also fell walking on the sidewalk a couple of weeks ago because the sidewalk had not been touched at all and was slippery from being trampled down by pedestrians. This gas station makes more than enough money from charging exorbitant amounts of money for parking during Fenway events that are far more expensive than the cost of a ticket for illegally parking in resident parking areas. This encourages out of town drivers to take up resident's already limited parking in the neighborhood, making living conditions difficult for those who call this neighborhood home.","requested_datetime":"2015-02-19T21:56:46-05:00","updated_datetime":"2015-02-24T09:19:41-05:00","address":"1390 Boylston St, Boston","lat":42.34329166666667,"long":-71.10221116666666,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/54e6a26404859c1f0a3393a7/report.jpg"},
