It's a mess! \n\nTo top it off, you can't even pass on the sidewalk in front of #1 O'Donnell Square & the crosswalk I am speaking about is in front of the flower pots & is completely covered in snow, as are the wheelchair ramps at the curbs. What prompted my complaint was that I watched school kids struggle through it on Friday & an elderly woman try to walk through it on Saturday morning & when she walked back & tried to walk on the sidewalk it was an icy, snow covered mess. & it STILL is.

Not a single snow flake had been removed from it since the snow stopped falling a week ago.  I had to walk onto the busy road on Bowdoin St, dodging the fast moving cars and buses. It\u2019s a dangerous situation.  I took a picture to report it. \n \nAs I took that picture, there was a kid trudging through the snow trying to catch his school bus \u2013see attached pic.   One of his shoes got caught, and he fell face first into the frozen snow. I offered to help him, but he declined.  He eventually picked himself up, walked barefoot to retrieve his lost shoe with one barefoot, emptied the shoe filled with snow, and made his way into the bus.  At best, he probably ended up with a wet and frozen foot for the rest of the day which was quite upsetting to see.\n \nWhen I got home, I looked up the property address, and I found that the absentee owner is now trying to sell it for $1.3 million.  Yet, he can\u2019t be bothered to spend a penny to clear up the snow nor show an ounce of respect for the neighborhood.  \n \nhttp://www.zillow.com/homedetails/171-181-Bowdoin-Boston-dorchester-MA-02124/2109811697_zp id/\n \nAlthough only one address shows up when doing a search (181 Bowdoin St.), the City of Boston website shows that this long section of un-shoveled sidewalk consist of 4 separate commercial properties, all of them belonging to the same \u201cCASSERLY JOHN\u201d.
