Instead, my neighbor at 96 Westchester has a ground water problem; a spring is constantly streaming water from her driveway and into the sidewalk. Given that we live on a hill, the water from her driveway leaks on to the sidewalk directly in front of my house (my house is down-hill from hers). I have spoken to this neighbor multiple times over the last 2 months to address this problem, for fear that the cold weather would turn this water into ice. Well, my fear has become a reality; there is now a solid sheet of ice right in front of the steps to my house. This is now very unsafe not only for my family (with 2 children under 8), but also for anyone else who visits my home, from friends and relatives, to the postman, and any emergency personnel (should they ever, God forbid!, need to have to access my house). Unfortunately, my neighbor is either unwilling or unable to address the problem. And so I'm now left with asking the City to help address this problem. Can you please suggest how I might resolve this? thanks!
