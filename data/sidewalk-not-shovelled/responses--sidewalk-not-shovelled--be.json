Someone came out last week and took information down (and clearly said \"I know you didn't do this\") but I got a email reply yesterday stating that violation was NOT found. During the Blizzard a plow driver contracted to remove snow from Milton ave/Codman hill ave took snow from other areas of the stree and plowed onto the sidewalk on my property which blocks a wheel chair ramp. The pile is too large to remove myself. During the snow storm this past Monday another plow driver added more snow to this. The plow drivers also blocked my driveway. The corner of my house where the wheel chair ramp is blocked is very dangerous because no one can walk on my sidewalk the children have to walk out into the street \"behind\" the snow bank and risk getting hit by a car. A handicap person had to use the street that is located on a hill that was icy. This is unacceptable! I understand that there is nowhere to put the snow but plowing it onto someones property, blocking a wheel chair ramp and plowing snow into someone's driveway should NOT be tolerated. This happens every year and after shoveling for hours it's not fair that a city plow is able to do this. What steps need to be taken to have the snow that was pushed onto my sidewalk by a city plow removed?

Furthermore, 49 Tremont Street also fails to adequately shovel the driveway and parking area. The street in front of the parking area routinely has deep loose snow in front which is suspected to be caused from shoveling snow from the driveway and large parking area into the street. This causes a slip hazard on the slight downward slope as cars and pedestrians pass in front of the driveway. Additionally, snow in front of the driveway also prevents employees of the facility from expeditiously parking vehicles which blocks traffic on Tremont street for 15 minutes or more as employees struggle to move their cars in the deep snow. In the 4 years I have been a resident at 21 Tremont street, 49 Tremont Street has never removed snow from the sidewalks facing Prospect street, curb ramps, or hydrants. I request that the city immediately exercise its authority under Boston Code of Ordinances, 16-12.16 paragraphs a and c and require that the facility at 49 Tremont street clear snow from all walks, curb ramps, hydrants and the street in front of the parking area. Due to the habitual nature of these violations, I further request ongoing monitoring and enforcement Boston's snow regulations at and around the facility at 49 Tremont Street until the end of winter.
