That should never happen during rush hour there should be police that go in there and clean them out. One of the busiest thorough fairs in Boston is held up by some shit stain parking in the middle of the street that wanted to get spicy Korean fried wings. I like spicy Korean Fried wings a whole lot and myself, but I would never ever ever park in the middle of the street during rush hour. What a selfish thing to do! These people need to be stopped.
