{"service_request_id":"101001179247","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Resolved. This is not occupancy work. The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving. It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes. The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of  the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt  that provides the smooth ride. The street is leafleted before the work begins where it explains that it is a mufti phase construction operation and you should look at the dates since they will change as each construction phases progresses. Our goal is to allow parking between phases and not post the street for the entire time the work takes place. This is why the contractor repeatedly changes the dates. We spoke to the contractor about his need to be totally accurate when posting for upcoming work. Since this is a patching contract, the contractor may only be on your street for only a short period of time; giving the appearance of not showing up. Sometimes  poor weather, plant breakdowns, or equipment failure occurs which results in the delay of the upcoming work. The CIU spoke to the contractor about his need to do a better job on changing the dates when those situations arise. Any questions you call the City Hall at 617-635-4950. The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

The good thing is that NStar gas is replacing an old cast iron main, and this will eliminate possible emergency leak repairs in the future.
