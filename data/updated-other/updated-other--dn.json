We might  have missed it and when I mentioned this and gestured to all the people standing at the bus stop the bus driver he said \"well, they can read...\".

He might have pulled away, if the mbta employee had not gestured for him to pull in and allow a senior man come aboard with his walker. \n\nSuggestion: inform bus drivers of regular bus routes of the T delays so they are aware of the increased quantity of passengers.
