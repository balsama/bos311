Now, with parking meters throughout the city having been replaced by new credit-card-reading individual units or multi-space ticket machines, my remaining cards that still have value are useless. How can I get the money left on them refunded to me? I paid for these cards with the expectation that I would be able to use them to pay for parking, and now that I can't, I believe it's only fair that I receive a refund on the unused value. Before all of the meters were replaced, the cards were (and, I assume, still are) functioning properly.
