{"service_request_id":"101001800134","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. National Grid is installing a new main on your street. The city highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs. The city acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However in the long run the construction is well worth it. Having a street dug up for emergency repairs soon after paving is frustrating for all. With the new gas main installed, the city can feel extremely comfortable that no embarrassing street cuts will happen if it determines to pave your street in the future. Normally when excavating in the City, the utility companies or contractors will use a backhoe to excavate the gravel material to a proper depth in order to place the new main. The problem is in certain neighborhoods in Boston, especially in the Downtown area, Beacon Hill, Back Bay North End etc.. is that there are so many pipes and conduits close to each other that the backhoe can not physically remove the gravel. In addition they could hit infrastructure such as a gas main and cause major issues. The only way to remove the gravel material is to vacuum it out.  Once the pipes are exposed they have to finish the digging by hand. We acknowledge that they vacuum excavation truck is loud. We have asked the contractor to make sure they reach out to all residents and businesses before performing the vacuum excavation operation. The good news is that the vacuum excavation does not need to be done 8 hours a day, but only when needed. The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector states the work should be completed within 2 weeks. I am including the Feeney Brothers and National Grid contact information.

The issue of landscaping was discussed during the community process and, based on feedback from the community; a preferred design was chosen that did not include any landscaping elements.

It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes. The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride. What the constituent observed was the patch awaiting final top course. The work is expected to be completed this week. The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

{"service_request_id":"101001796880","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. National Grid is installing a new gas main.  The city encourages this type of capital upgrade work.  It will eliminate future emergency repairs. National Grid has to install the gas main first.  Once the main has been installed, then all service connections can be made. If the city were to make National Grid pave to grade each day's trench work,  it would cause multiple seams along the trench.  More importantly, every service connection needs to be cut into the trench.  If we were to pave the trench every day,  this would result in 2 by 2 patches in front of every house inside the trench area, resulting in a very poor final product.  In order to have the best final paving, the city allows the utility company to leave the trench down low until all service connections are made and then pave the trench all at once, resulting in a smooth, level final trench repair.  Service laterals are topped within 24 hours of excavation. What the constituent is observing is the trench left down low in preparation for one continuous final paving operation. The trench is scheduled to be paved by the end of this week. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

The issue of landscaping was discussed during the community process and, based on feedback from the community; a preferred design was chosen that did not include any landscaping elements. The final design will incorporate a red imprinted brick pattern in the areas of the sidewalk that are currently paved with asphalt. The installation of the imprinted pattern is scheduled to be installed soon.

Before excavating in Massachusetts, its the law to call dig safe so that out all the underground utilities are marked out with paint. This allows the contractor to dig safely and not to hit an underground utility line such as the gas main. Its is rightfully so a mandatory requirement . The City does shares your frustration that after the work is complete the paint could be being viewed as graffiti by the public. We have reached out to the utility companies asking if they could develop a paint that wore off more quickly. Obviously the paint needs to stay visible while the work takes place. Its a dilemma that we are working on, its not an easy remedy .. however its important to remember that Public Safety trumps all. Eventually the paint should wear off over time. If the markings are still there in the next 60 -90 days please contact my office. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.
