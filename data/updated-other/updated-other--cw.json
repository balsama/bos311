We are aware of this issue and have already had an electrician examine the situation. There are lightbulbs that are out and we are currently gathering quotes to replace them as a bucket truck needs to be used so it is not a job we can do in-house. As soon as we finish this process and select the vendor, the work will get done. . If you have any further questions, feel free to stop by Pat's office for an update. . Sandy. . . .

The Boston Public Works  Department is currently reconstructing Staniford and Causeway Streets.  In addition we are allowing some utility work to be done before the final paving is scheduled. When completed it will be a major improvement for  the pedestrians, cyclists and motorists who travel these street daily. We acknowledge the construction is a major inconvenience to the public. We have police details called in every day. They obviously will help with traffic control and public safety. You will also notice more jersey barriers and barricades in use to help guide pedestrians and traffic through and around the work zones. We have asked the contractor to restore all pavement markings within their work zone even if they have not disturbed the markings. This means that all crosswalks/ double yellows/skip lines/ arrow onlys etc will be maintained throughout the project. All temporary pavement markings will be completed by November 6th. We ask for your patience while this major project takes place. For any questions or concerns, please contact the project engineer Kay Barned-Smith at 617-635-4951. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

This will improve the reliability of electrical service in South Boston. The contractor is McCourt. The transmission line work requires more plates than usual do to the complications of this type of work. We told the contractor McCourt though we acknowledge securing a large amount of plates is not easy it has to be done. They need to berm the plates properly every time they leave the job, this will require them to wedge the plates, pin them, and tac weld problem plates when necessary. The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) regularly inspects the work and has found for the most part they are in compliance with our rules and regs. We met with them recently and reviewed our procedures especially regarding plates, and we feel that you will have less complaints about loud noise. The City acknowledges this is a major project and is an inconvenience to the residents of the street and we appreciate your patience and cooperation.
