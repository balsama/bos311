{"service_request_id":"101003260472","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Noted. BTD continues to have many traffic signals in the city center and dense residential areas.(Back Bay, South End, Longwood Medical area, etc.) on pedestrian recall, where a pedestrian does not need to press the button to get a walk signal.  The hours for typical pedestrian recall are 7AM to 8PM or even as late as 11PM.  These locations are where there are typically large amounts of pedestrians crossing throughout the day.  Locations where typical pedestrian crossings are fewer are not in pedestrian recall and the button must be pressed to get a walk signal.  At large intersections with heavy traffic but few pedestrians, pedestrian recall  would cause all traffic to stop up to 40 seconds whether there was pedestrian actually waiting to cross the street or not.  This would cause undue delay to bicycles, buses, cars, trucks, and other modes of surface transportation.  It could also lead to driver frustration and a disregard to the traffic signal.  Putting a traffic signal is pedestrian recall in a low pedestrian area would be similar to pressing all the buttons on an elevator to stop at each floor, whether you wanted to stop on that floor or not.  That would lead to frustration using that elevator. In the meantime during the shutdown, BTD is operating the online traffic signals at shorter off-peak cycle lengths which will reduce delays for all users.  As for the pedestrian buttons, we suggest you treat them as any other object in the public domain such as elevator buttons, doorknobs, etc.  Use your elbow, or the cuff of your sleeve to avoid touching the buttons directly with your hands.  Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, use hand sanitizer, and avoid touching your face in public.

The light is time so that it keeps the traffic on Tremont Street from getting through the green light at Ruggles Street 100 yards ahead.
