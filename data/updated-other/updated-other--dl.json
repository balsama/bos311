{"service_request_id":"101001252306","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Noted. Thank you for contacting the Boston Transportation Department regarding your concerns with the operation and safety concerns of the the intersection and traffic signal at Columbus Avenue and Dartmouth Street. We are aware of the tragic accident that occurred between a school bus and a pedestrian and his dog. I want to assure you we are looking at remedies to improve the operation at this intersection. It is quite challenging due to the traffic volumes, two-way streets on both Dartmouth St and Columbus Avenue, limited geometry to allow widening for turn lanes, and pedestrian volumes as well. We are in the process of retiming the Back Bay traffic signals and this intersection is part of the study. Our goal is to come up with a signal phasing that will improve pedestrian safety and accommodate vehicles as well, without causing more backups in your neighborhood. Currently, the traffic signal has concurrent walks for pedestrians (Walks in the same direction of traffic) and it also has turning arrows from Dartmouth SB to Columbus inbound as well as a right turn arrow from Columbus outbound to Dartmouth northbound.  One issue we have observed is pedestrians crossing Columbus Ave on the east side during the turning arrow phases even though the pedestrian signals display Don't Walk.  They see the traffic signal on Columbus Ave turn red and assume they can walk across, especially from south to north where they cannot see the turning arrows. The benefit of an exclusive only pedestrian phase (all-walk, all-red for cars) is it is the absolute safest condition for pedestrians.  The downside to an exclusive is it adds delays to the overall intersection causing longer vehicular queues, longer cycle lengths (the amount of time for a signal to serve all approaches before starting over), and even longer pedestrian delays because a pedestrian will have to wait for other phases to happen before finally receiving the exclusive all-walk.  This can lead to pedestrians becoming impatient and jaywalking, putting themselves in harms way. Our current plan is to add an exclusive pedestrian phase.  Our study shows the north crosswalk across Dartmouth St is best to only operate under this condition due to the amount of left and right turning vehicles from Columbus Avenue to Dartmouth St NB.  This crosswalk will only turn on during the exclusive pedestrian phase and will display Don't Walk at all other times.  All other crosswalks will also be on during the exclusive pedestrian phase but will remain on during the concurrent traffic phases as well.  We will also eliminate the turn arrows on Dartmouth SB and Columbus outbound to Dartmouth NB, since our analysis shows arrows are not warranted and have a limited effect without a dedicated left-turn lane on to store traffic and there is no room to add one. A hybrid exclusive/concurrent pedestrian operation should improve pedestrian safety but also not increase pedestrian delay too much overall. I hope I explained our understanding of the situation and our plan that we hope to enact in Spring 2015 (some of the improvements require restriping and we must wait until after the winter).  Before then we will be making some adjustments to yellow/red times and pedestrian times to the way the signal currently operates.","service_name":"Other","service_code":"4f38920fe75084437f0001a0","description":"Please please please do something about the pedestrian right of way at this intersection.

As stated in the original CRM the ADA requires that all crosswalks need a pedestrian ramp on either side. If you are in a wheel chair how can you access a crosswalk where there is curb stone?  In this particular location there was one ramp on one side and edge stone on the other side. In addition the crosswalk was right where the buses pulled up in front of the school. Basically is appears that the crosswalk was installed without meeting specifications for the convenience of people trying to get access to the school. That is why the engineer could not replace that particular crosswalk. Hopefully this explains the situation. If you would like to further discuss this you can contact me at the number listed below.

The Boston Public Works Department Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) has identified the sidewalk left in asphalt as belonging to National Grid.

Now during a Red Sox game there is absolutely no place to park during a Red Sox game because they will not allow you to use the handicapped spot behind CVS because it is apparently owned by to company who sells spaces behind CVS. I asked to just use the handicapped spot behind CVS but was refused. Why is there no handicapped parking near this pharmacy. I bring a person who is also handicapped and that pharmacy is one of a few where he needs nutritional supplement and can't carry it home to Westland Ave. Walgreens provides this kind of access.","requested_datetime":"2013-10-06T08:59:31-04:00","updated_datetime":"2015-01-02T12:47:18-05:00","address":"176 Ipswich St, Boston","lat":42.34592658705814,"long":-71.09542160792539},
