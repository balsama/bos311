{"service_request_id":"101000936398","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Resolved. The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving. Professionally permanent patching of utility cuts and potholes will improve the ride of the street as well as maintain its integrity. The work is done in multiple phases. Phase 1. Saw cut the painted areas on the street. Phase 2. Dig out  those painted areas 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but has  large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride. Phase 3. Within one a week come back and top the patches. The top course is the hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride. The street is leafleted before the work begins where it explains that it is a mufti phase construction operation and you should look at the dates since they will change as each construction phases progresses. Our goal is to allow parking between phases and not post the street for the entire time the work takes place. Patch paving is not an exact science and some times delays happen, weather , plant break downs, equipment failure ect. We do tell the contractor that if they know there is a delay to change the dates to reflect the new schedule. We also understand that parking is at a premium in the city and that we are causing an inconvenience by not allowing parking during construction but once again the work will improve the quality of your street. The City apologizes when the schedule is not maintained and cars are moved and nobody shows up as in this case. The contractor was spoken to about tightening up and strictly following the multiple phase schedule. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

{"service_request_id":"101000939889","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Resolved. The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving. Professionally permanent patching of utility cuts and potholes will improve the ride of the street as well as maintain its integrity. The work is done in multiple phases. Phase 1. Saw cut the painted areas on the street. Phase 2. Dig out  those painted areas 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but has  large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride. Phase 3. Within one a week come back and top the patches. The top course is the hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride. The street is leafleted before the work begins where it explains that it is a mufti phase construction operation and you should look at the dates since they will change as each construction phases progresses. Our goal is to allow parking between phases and not post the street for the entire time the work takes place. Patch paving is not an exact science and some times delays happen, weather , plant break downs, equipment failure ect. We do tell the contractor that if they know there is a delay to change the dates to reflect the new schedule. We also understand that parking is at a premium in the city and that we are causing an inconvenience by not allowing parking during construction but once again the work will improve the quality of your street. The City apologizes when the schedule is not maintained and cars are moved and nobody shows up as in this case. The contractor was spoken to about tightening up and strictly following the multiple phase schedule. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.
