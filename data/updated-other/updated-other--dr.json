{"service_request_id":"101001159677","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Resolved. National Grid is installing a new gas main.  The city encourages this type of capital upgrade work.  It will eliminate future emergency repairs. National Grid has to install the gas main first.  Once the main has been installed, then all service connections can be made. If the city were to make National Grid pave to grade each day's trench work,  it would cause multiple seams along the trench.  More importantly, every service connection needs to be cut into the trench.  If we were to pave the trench every day,  this would result in 2 by 2 patches inside the trench area, resulting in a very poor final product. In order to have the best final paving, the city allows the utility company to leave the trench down low until all service connections are made and then pave the trench all at once, resulting in a smooth, level final trench repair.  Service laterals are topped within 24 hours of excavation. What the constituent is observing is the trench left down low in preparation for one continuous final paving operation. The trench is scheduled to be paved next week. Mark Cardarelli called the constituent and reviewed above information. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.
