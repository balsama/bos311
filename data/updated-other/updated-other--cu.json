{"service_request_id":"101001678315","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU)  investigated and determined the following:. MassDOT is replacing the Mass Av Bridge. The bridge is in desperate need of replacement. Before the bridge work takes place certain utility conduits/ mains need to be re-located first. That is the construction you are talking about. Because this is a very fast tracked project we are letting the work take place. We are acknowledging its an inconvenience to the neighborhood. The good news is that instead of a typical bridge replacement job that literally takes years, the MassDOT will come in next year and in 3 days place a pre fab bridge. Its a technology that has obviously greatly lessened the impact to the surrounding neighborhoods. Once again thank you for patience as this most important work takes place. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

{"service_request_id":"101001677844","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. After reading the notes about the case, I contacted Feeney Brothers ASAP to determine what happened out there yesterday on River St. Eversource Gas replaced the gas main on this section of River St in anticipation of the City's scheduled  paving in 2016. This will eliminate the very frustrating scenario for everybody of the gas company repairing emergency gas leaks on a newly paved street. The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) determined that sections of the temporary trench were not to City standards. We told Feeney to take care of the low areas before December 23rd. Feeney hired a contractor to mill the low areas and then pave. According to the sub contractor the milling machine broke down around 3pm. Obviously this caused major traffic issues and concerns. The subcontractor knew that he had to get the milling machine off the street as soon as possible.  He had it towed between 5-6pm. There were police officers on detail and they had equipment parked in front of the milling machine. He apologized for what happened. They are back out there today trying to complete the job. I called Feeney and told them that they should have contacted me or the CIU  right away on what was transpiring. Going forward in situations like this, they will contact the CIU. I apologize for the impression that you saw as your drove on River St  that the milling machine was just left there willy nilly for the convenience of the contractor and at the expense of the motorist. Obviously after reading my response you know that is not the case. Thank you for understanding. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector investigated and determined the following:. BWSC was repairing the hydrant at 455 Mass Ave. The sidewalk needed to be closed in order for the work to be done. You have two options when you are closing the sidewalk. 1.  You place a temporary ramps in asphalt against the edgestone and create a temporary path of travel  onto the roadway in front of the work zone. 2.  You place sidewalk closed signs at the nearest ramp at the end of the work zone telling pedestrians that the access to the sidewalk is closed and you need to cross to the other side. Because Boston has narrow streets it can be dangerous to try to have pedestrians go into the roadway. Mass Ave is one of the most traveled arterials in the City.  It is safer for the pedestrians to cross the street, then to walk into Mass Ave. In addition you would be taking a lane of traffic away from a busy street. The good news is the job is completed, and we apologize for the inconvenience. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

Starting as early as December 1, 2015, Eversource contractors will commence work on H Street between East Fifth and East Seventh Street.  This phase of the project is a 24/7 operation required to pull cable and splice the new transmission lines.  This process is estimated to be two weeks in duration. Parking restrictions will be necessary, and will be clearly posted in advance of activities with dates.   Some temporary modifications to traffic patterns will be necessary during construction.   Police officers will be present during construction to facilitate safe pedestrian and vehicular access. There are no scheduled power interruptions as a result of these operations. Thank you in advance for your cooperation and assistance while Eversource works. to construct this critical infrastructure project. For more information on this project, please call John Hoey, Community Relations Specialist, at 617-541-7634, or email: john.hoey@eversource.com.","service_name":"Other","service_code":"4f38920fe75084437f0001a0","description":"Filed a previous ticket.

Conflicting signs increase the chance of an accident. The signs along the right side of the road that say \"Right lane must turn right\"  should be covered up or removed (it is better for the left lane to be for left turns and the right lane to have the option to go straight). \nThe user entered the address: 710 North Harvard Street, Boston, Massachusetts to see more details visit: http://seeclickfix.com/issues/2088059","requested_datetime":"2015-12-04T15:10:20-05:00","updated_datetime":"2015-12-04T15:10:00-05:00","address":"710 North Harvard Street, Boston, Massachusetts","lat":42.3681636977962,"long":-71.1238528576721},
