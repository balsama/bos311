Below is a picture if signs that are in the  Boston Common. These signs should be posted in all the parking lots just before entering into the parks fenced area. Proper patrolling and ticketing would also be helpful. Please do not wait until a tragedy happens.

{"service_request_id":"101001089619","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Resolved. The Boston Public Works requires utility companies or private contractors to place florescent reflective signs on poles whenever a steel plate is to be used, or a trench is down low awaiting the final top course. This allows the Public to know before the drive over a plate or a trench in progress, so that they can proceed with caution. It improves safety for both motorists, and the crews. South Boston has a tremendous amount of utility work being done. Most of the work is for new water, sewer, and drain mains. This will dramatically improve the infrastructure of the South Boston neighborhood. When the work is completed, the City will pave the streets, and not have to worry about emergency repairs being made soon after paving. You are correct that the signs should be removed after the work is done. The sign on H St has been removed.

The close up picture of a needle up against a wall was not real useful. The website/phone app should really have a suggestion to take a picture from a distance with an identifiable landmark visible in the picture. Taking a close up picture of a needle against a wall really does not help very much. I am not sure who would be update the site/app.   The same applies to the other Bio Waste located on Mt Washington St. The Division 1 supervisor investigated this one and he walked up and down the waterfront looking but a needle is so small that without something to narrow down the location...it does not help.  The picture is relatively up close and nothing but a couple rocks and water in the back ground. A note on the website and/or phone app would go a long way in resolving the Bio waste and avoid needlessly having resources (that are already spread pretty thin) being tied up. ...and as I type this...Division 1 found 12 needles in the area of Mt Washington Street along the Harborwalk .

I hope you are doing great. We definitely are aware of the expansion joint issue. The City does not. have jurisdiction over the joints itself, but I  have had numerous. conversations with the state and they are aware of the issue. With that. said, the City does have the ability to do signage and pavement markings in. the area. Last year we installed signs and pavement markings in response to. the crash. The pavement markings guide the cyclists to the left side of the. road where the joints are safe. The signage alerts the cyclists to the. issue as well. Despite the efforts, we still are having crashes.  We already added more. signage alerting cyclists.  In addition, after more field work I had our. engineers design much more visible and robust pavement markings that will. be almost impossible to miss.  The in-house engineering team is reviewing. now (they know it is urgent) and I hope to get those installed right away. Thanks so much Craig and keep smiling,. Nicole Freedman.
