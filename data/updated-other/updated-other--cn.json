{"service_request_id":"101001839550","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving. It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes.  The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of  the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt  that provides the smooth ride. The street is leafleted before the work begins where it explains that it is a mufti phase construction operation and you should look at the dates since they will change as each construction phases progresses. Our goal is to allow parking between phases and not post the street for the entire time the work takes place. This is why the contractor repeatedly changes the dates. We spoke to the contractor about his need to be totally accurate when posting and leafletting  for upcoming work. Since this is a patching contract, the contractor may only be on your street for only a short period of time; giving the appearance of not showing up. Sometimes poor weather, plant breakdowns, or equipment failure occurs which results in the delay of the upcoming work. The CIU spoke to the contractor about his need to do a better job on changing the dates when those situations arise. Any questions you call the City Engineer Marty Lee at. 617-755-9119.  The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.  Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

The city highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs. The city acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However in the long run the construction is well worth it. Having a street dug up for emergency repairs soon after paving is frustrating for all. With the new gas main installed, the city can feel extremely comfortable that no embarrassing street cuts will happen if it determines to pave your street in the future. Even though the contractor will installing a new main usually for hundreds of feet and in some cases the entire street, we have told the contractor to only post where he will be for the next few days. This will allow more parking on the street. . We spoke to the crew and told them they have to follow this requirement . They apologized and said they would comply going forward.

{"service_request_id":"101001811793","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. National Grid is installing a new gas main.  The city encourages this type of capital upgrade work.  It will eliminate future emergency repairs. National Grid has to install the gas main first.  Once the main has been installed, then all service connections can be made. If the city were to make National Grid pave to grade each day's trench work,  it would cause multiple seams along the trench. More importantly, every service connection needs to be cut into the trench.  If we were to pave the trench every day,  this would result in 2 by 2 patches inside the trench area, resulting in a very poor final product. In order to have the best final paving, the city allows the utility company to leave the trench down low until all service connections are made and then pave the trench all at once, resulting in a smooth, level final trench repair. Service laterals are topped within 24 hours of excavation. What the constituent is observing is the trench left down low in preparation for one continuous final paving operation. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

{"service_request_id":"101001811851","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving. It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes. The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of  the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt  that provides the smooth ride. The street is leafleted before the work begins where it explains that it is a mufti phase construction operation and you should look at the dates since they will change as each construction phases progresses. Our goal is to allow parking between phases and not post the street for the entire time the work takes place. This is why the contractor repeatedly changes the dates. Since this is a patching contract, the contractor may only be on your street for only a short period of time; giving the appearance of not showing up. Sometimes poor weather, plant breakdowns, or equipment failure occurs which results in the delay of the upcoming work. Any questions you call the City Engineer Tom Mougamian. 617-304-7308.

{"service_request_id":"101001810364","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving. It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes.  The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of  the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt  that provides the smooth ride. The street is leafleted before the work begins where it explains that it is a mufti phase construction operation and you should look at the dates since they will change as each construction phases progresses. Our goal is to allow parking between phases and not post the street for the entire time the work takes place. This is why the contractor repeatedly changes the dates. We spoke to the contractor about his need to be totally accurate when posting and leafletting  for upcoming work. Since this is a patching contract, the contractor may only be on your street for only a short period of time; giving the appearance of not showing up. Sometimes poor weather, plant breakdowns, or equipment failure occurs which results in the delay of the upcoming work.  The CIU spoke to the contractor about his need to do a better job on changing the dates when those situations arise. The work is now completed. Any questions you call the City Engineer Tom Mougamian. 617-304-7308.  The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.  Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector has identified that vault on the sidewalk needing attention as the responsibility of Eversource Electric. Replacing or repairing vaults is not an easy repair. Eversource has to have the vaults custom made for each separate location. This takes time.  In addition the construction itself is technical and involved, as well as expensive. We have informed Eversource Electric that they have to set aside resources to repair vaults around the City. The estimated time for replacement is 6-9 months. However, we will require Eversource to make a temporary repair such as the use of asphalt, especially if it is a major tripping hazard. The temporary repair should be done within 3 business days. For any questions or concern, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.
