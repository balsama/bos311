Why do the developers in this town get the upper hand and long time residents are constantly getting punished for the over development. Clearly there is an over population issue as the neighborhood has already been turned in to resident parking 7 days a week and now spots are being taking away...in the winter no less when parking becomes even worse. Please figure out a proper solution and maybe give the neighborhood a courteous forewarning the next time significant parking is being taking as well as moving a bus stop.","requested_datetime":"2014-12-16T07:02:21-05:00","updated_datetime":"2015-10-08T12:58:04-04:00","address":"21\u201349 P St, Boston","lat":42.33694666666667,"long":-71.0272305,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/54901f3d696308df59b3e8f8/report.jpg"},

As you are well aware of South Boston has had years of new utility infrastructure work. Having new gas , water, sewer, and drain mains is a major benefit to the residents of South Boston but it has also been a major inconvenience.  . Most of the utility work is done.  The City is now paving many of the streets that were impacted by the work. East Broadway was one of them. The City wants to pave between West Broadway and K St.  In order to do this as fast as possible with minimum inconvenience, we did allow the cold planner to start earlier than usual. Instead of being out there between 2-3 weeks we should be completed within a week or so. The cold planning is done.  All remaining phases of work will be done after 7am. The City thanks you for your patience. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of  the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt  that provides the smooth ride. What you observed was the patch in binder awaiting the final top course.  Any questions you call the City Engineer Tom Mougamian. 617-304-7308.  The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.  Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor was working on your street performing patch paving. It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes.  The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of  the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt  that provides the smooth ride.  The street is leafleted before the work begins where it explains that it is a mufti phase construction operation and you should look at the dates since they will change as each construction phases progresses.  Our goal is to allow parking between phases and not post the street for the entire time the work takes place. This is why the contractor repeatedly changes the dates. We spoke to the contractor about his need to be totally accurate when posting and leafleting  for upcoming work.  Since this is a patching contract, the contractor may only be on your street for only a short period of time; giving the appearance of not showing up.  Sometimes  poor weather, plant breakdowns, or equipment failure occurs which results in the delay of the upcoming work.  The CIU spoke to the contractor about his need to do a better job on changing the dates when those situations arise.  Any questions you call the City Engineer Tom Mougamian. 617-304-7308.

{"service_request_id":"101001581068","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving. It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes. The utility work previously done on your street was left with a temporary patch. The City of Boston does not want the permanent asphalt cross section (typically 6.5\" on residential street and 7.5\"on main arterials) to be put back after the gravel down to the pipe has been disturbed. There is a possibility that settlement could occur. Thats why the City waits before performing the cross section repair.  Our permanent patches hardly ever settle and that is the goal that any City or Town would want to happen regarding utility excavation work. We do have a unit that inspects backfilling and temporary patches (The Construction Inspection Unit CIU) The CIU does stay on top of the contractors and utility companies.  Many of the temporary patches are in good condition. However, the key is the patch is only 3\".  We need the full cross section put back. This is what you are seeing being done on your street right now. Below is the steps taken to do the permanent repair. The construction process is to dig out 6.5 to 7.5\" inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride. I hope this explanation clarifies things for you. If not please don't hesitate to call me. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.
