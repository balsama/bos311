The smell is awful and they stain the sidewalks with everything that leaks out of the bags as they drag it to the dump. As residents, for the past 25 years, this is VERY upsetting!!  We walk on the sidewalks and then track all that into our homes. The North End is SO filthy after these Feasts. There is trash, broken glass, people urinating on our house and then the city allows a trash dump in front of our house! It is unacceptable and I don't think anyone would like a trash dump set up in front of their house. The same thing happened last year and sidewalks and street were never cleaned so we had to live the lingering smell even after the trash was removed.

It is an important city service for your neighborhood. There are multiple phases of construction. 1.  Sawcut all utility trenches and patches. 2.  Permanently repair those trenches and patches. 3.  Mill the street curb to curb. 4.  Adjust all castings.(manholes etc..). 5.  Pave the street. We don't want the contractor to post the street continuously when the phases are done separately and there are days in-between the phases. The Public Works goal is to allow parking in-between phases. That's why the dates continuously change. In addition sometimes poor weather, plant breakdowns, or equipment failure occurs which results in the delay of the upcoming work. The CIU spoke to the contractor about his need to do a better job on changing the dates when those situations arise. Any questions regarding the schedule or any other issue, you call the City Engineer Tom Mougamian. 617-304-7308. The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused. Sincerely,.

{"service_request_id":"101001431352","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Noted. Thank you for contacting the Boston Transportation Department. We understand your concerns and have made a number of improvements here within the past few years to help with vehicular speeds. The only crosswalk in this vicinity is signal controlled and therefore is as safe as we can currently make it. We're limited to where we can install stop signs by the MUTCD federal guidelines, which none of the other nearby intersections meet since Main St is a main road. As for the roadway itself, through the help of Boston Bikes, we have narrowed the travel lanes to make the road feel narrower and this has reduced average speeds. Boston currently does not have a program for speed humps, however, given that Main St is a main arterial and a bus route, it would not qualify for raised control devices.","service_name":"Other","service_code":"4f38920fe75084437f0001a0","description":"Now that we have had a pedestrian hit on Main Street will something finally be done to address the speed with which cars and oft MBTA buses drive down the street.

{"service_request_id":"101001439518","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Noted. Thank you for contacting the Boston Transportation Department (BTD) regarding your request to replace concurrent pedestrian crossing with exclusive pedestrian crossings  at Berkeley Street & Boylston Street. Over the years, BTD is developing traffic signal timing and phasing that reduces delays for vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians.  Part of this strategy is to remove exclusive pedestrian phases and replace with concurrent pedestrian phases where engineering reviews show it is safe to do so. While an exclusive pedestrian phase provides pedestrians sole access to an intersection without potential conflicts with turning vehicles, exclusive pedestrian phases can also lead to the following negative issues:. 1. Pedestrians will often have to wait a long time for an exclusive pedestrian phase.  As a result, many pedestrians will simply choose to ignore the signal and cross if and when a gap in traffic occurs. 2.   An exclusive pedestrian phase may increase the overall cycle length of the intersection, thus increasing delay for all users.  Since converting many Back Bay traffic signals to concurrent pedestrian crossings, BTD has been able to reduce the cycle lengths by 10 seconds each time of day at most locations. With concurrent signals, pedestrians usually have more crossing opportunities and shorter waits. BTD's criteria to use exclusive pedestrian phases include:. 1 Restricted turning sight distance. 2 Intersection geometry dictates that concurrent pedestrian crossings may be confusing or dangerous. 3  Intersections defined within \"safety zones\" near elderly housing, schools, playgrounds, health facilities, etc. 4  Vehicle/pedestrian crashes. It should also be noted that BTD received requests to replace exclusive pedestrian phases with concurrent crossings in the Back Bay by the community and pedestrian advocate groups to reduce pedestrian wait times. BTD recently conducted a signal retiming study of the Back Bay.  As part of the study, BTD conducted an inventory of missing Yield to Peds on Turn Signs at concurrent crossings.  BTD will be installing missing signs over the summer months. Whether posted or not, it is required by Mass. General Laws for turning vehicles to yield to pedestrians legally in the crosswalk when they have a Walk/Flashing Don't Walk indication.  If you are observing drivers not obeying this law, BTD suggests contacting the Boston Police Department, D4 Station, and request increased enforcement on this issue at specific locations you are encountering this infraction.","service_name":"Other","service_code":"4f38920fe75084437f0001a0","description":"Green light and walk signal occurring simultaneously at corner of Berkeley and Boylston.
