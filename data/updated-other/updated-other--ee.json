I have seen many people towed from this end spot, including myself, even when they only are an inch or two over the line which isn't even in the crosswalk or near a hydrant. That is pathetic. I say predatory too because the tow company sits and waits for this to inevitably happen sometimes during the day. I have warned several people not to park there.
