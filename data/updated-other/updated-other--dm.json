Also, the branches of the tree are hitting my house on the second floor and roof. I have asked for the branches to be cut, till now nothing has happened. The branches are too high for me to reach with a ladder. When I arrived home from work today the entire tree, from the bottom of the trunk to the top, is moving and it sounds like it is cracking noticeable.

{"service_request_id":"101001225363","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Resolved. The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Supervisor Mark Cardarelli called the constituent and informed him of the following:. National Grid is installing a new gas main.  The city encourages this type of capital upgrade work.  It will eliminate future emergency repairs. National Grid has to install the gas main first.  Once the main has been installed, then all service connections can be made. If the city were to make National Grid pave to grade each day's trench work,  it would cause multiple seams along the trench.  More importantly, every service connection needs to be cut into the trench. Paving the trench every day would end up with  2 by 2 patches in front of every house inside the paved trench area, resulting in a very poor final product.  In order to have the best final paving, the city allows the utility company to leave the trench down low until all service connections are made and then pave the trench all at once, resulting in a smooth, level final trench repair.  Service laterals are topped within 24 hours of excavation. What the constituent is observing is the trench left down low in preparation for one continuous final paving operation. Mark acknowledges that riding a bike through the work zone could be hazardous and he has ordered the contractor to post signs indicating the trench is down low. The trench is scheduled to be topped by December 19th. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.
