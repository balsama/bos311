The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving. It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes. The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride. What you  observed was the patch awaiting final top course. The work is now complete. The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.
