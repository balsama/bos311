Keane is a private contractor is installing a fire pipe for a property owner on Salem St. Obviously, fire protection is a public safety and that's why  the contractor is working on Salem St. All contractors, including Keane, call for police details. Sometimes the police do not show up for these details. In this case, the contractor wanted to get the work done before the  major feast this weekend. This is why they closed the street. Hopefully a police detail shows up today. The work is scheduled to be completed today. Thank you for your patience. Thanks,. Mark.
