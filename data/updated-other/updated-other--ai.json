As I sit here, mopeds are flying up and down the one way roads - often in the wrong direction. This has been a daily occurrence all summer and into the fall. Since posting about this issue in May 2015, I have seen two efforts to solve the problem: \r\n1. On one afternoon, I saw a cop patrolling the intersection to ticket those who did not stop at the stop sign. Only ONCE in a year and a half have I seen someone enforcing the stop signs. As a stay-at-home mom, we are outside nearly every day, rain or snow or shine, so it is unlikely that  it has been patrolled more often and I just missed it.\r\n2. A sign was hung that reads \"Drive Slow\" and has a picture of a running child. That's a nice gesture. However, the signs have been entirely ineffective considering the excessive speeding that still occurs at this intersection.\r\n\r\nI ask you respectfully to please again consider my request for speed humps which will actually slow the traffic and lead to a safer road for my children and my neighbors' children. Please let me know the procedure on how to obtain these. Do I need a signed petition by neighbors? If so, I know this can happen.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\nSincerely,\r\na concerned mother and neighbor \nThe user entered the address: 68 Monadnock St, Boston, Massachusetts to see more details visit: http:\/\/seeclickfix.com\/issues\/3017136","requested_datetime":"2016-10-21T14:04:16-04:00","updated_datetime":"2016-10-28T09:13:23-04:00","address":"68 Monadnock St, Boston, Massachusetts","lat":42.3147765,"long":-71.0692917},

I want to be compassionate but I am a young woman who lives alone, and he won't leave when asked. The front door of the building doesn't have a lock (to the outdoors) but the door between the vestibule and indoors does, so he sleeps in between the doors. It used to be just once in awhile, but it has become almost every night the past few weeks. He arrives around midnight most nights and is there until about 7am, or as late as noon on weekends, and no one can come or leave the building. He also urinates all over the front steps every morning. Is there any way to receive some assistance in finding this man a better place to stay so we can get in and out of the building?

The Boston Public Works Department did not issue a street opening permit to Spectra for the pipeline work. The Federal Government issued the permit which allows Spectra to work Monday through Saturday 7am to 7pm. The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) contacted Spectra and asked them why they were working beyond the Federally permitted hours .  They stated they had to do work on their substation on Grove St which is their private property.  They also stated that they tried to mitigate the noise through the use of sound blankets. They City informed Spectra going forward that if they were going to work on their private property they would notify the CIU 48 hours in advance. In addition, the City may have the noise levels measured to insure the decibel levels do not go above the City ordinance.  They agreed to those terms.

It is difficult to cross in the crosswalk(s) safely since drivers are often not willing\/able to stop for pedestrians. Can the crosswalks be better marked or patrolled?\n\n2.  The intersection of South Street at Guernsey Street, Roslindale. \nThere are school bus stops along this section of SOUTH St.  Drivers use excessive speed when exiting Centre Street onto (the much narrower and pedestrian route) South Street.
