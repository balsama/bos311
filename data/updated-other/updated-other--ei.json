The 43 families who lives in the building, we're displaced.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the displacement of our building due to the fire, our building Management placed about 10-15 families in other vacant apartments but refused to relocate us or give us any financial assistance during our time of need, but still continues to collect our percentage of subsidy from the government. I have been verbally disrespected and shown no attention by my building management and been threatened to have my lease terminated if I attempt to bring light to this unjust situation. An elderly female neighbor of mine with no financial means to find shelter was forced to sleep on a park bench. Another female neighbor and her children are eating, sleeping and living out of their car.

It will eliminate future emergency repairs. . National Grid has to install the gas main first.  Once the main has been installed, then all service connections can be made. . If the city were to make National Grid pave to grade each day's trench work,  it would cause multiple seams along the trench.  More importantly, every service connection needs to be cut into the trench.  If we were to pave the trench every day,  this would result in 2 by 2 patches inside the trench area, resulting in a very poor final product.  In order to have the best final paving, the city allows the utility company to leave the trench down low until all service connections are made and then pave the trench all at once, resulting in a smooth, level final trench repair.  Service laterals are topped within 24 hours of excavation. . What the constituent is observing is the trench left down low in preparation for one continuous final paving operation. . The trench is scheduled to be paved soon. . Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

We appreciate you submitting your comments for 12 Brewster Street, 526 East 8th Street, and 533 East 8th Street in South Boston. We have already begun an investigation, following the initial complaint we received regarding these locations. In our office, we have a formal process for investigating potential abuse of a Disabled Parking Space, and this process takes approximately a month. If you would like to follow up with our office regarding the investigation, please feel free to call the Mayor's Commission for Persons with Disabilities at (617) 635-3682. Again, thank you for taking the time to contact us and we hope to come to a resolution soon. In your comment, you also mentioned HP placard abuse. HP License Plates and Placards are run through the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles. They have a process for investigating potential placard abuse, and you can find out more about that process on their website: http://www.massrmv.com/rmv/hp_complaint/index.htm. Thank you,.
