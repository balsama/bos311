{"service_request_id":"101001872912","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The Boston Public Works Department has scheduled to do sidewalk repairs on the right side of M St coming down from East Broadway. We contacted the contractor after reading your case. The contractor stated the reason why he posted the whole right side  because he is doing a layout, and the layout should be done within the next couple of days. He also feels the work can be done in less than 2 weeks. He will only post where he will be for the next 2-3 days as he moves down the street which should allow parking to take place. We told him to change the dates to reflect his work schedule. In addition we told him that he should have leafleted the street which would have explained the construction. He apologized and said going forward he would leaflet all remaining streets on his schedule. The City apologizes for the inconvenience. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

I stop my bike where the lane ended and just waited until there weren't any cars so I could get out, even though the cars had a whole second lane on the left and are supposed to give me 3 feet of space I felt like I was going to be run down when I was in the travel lane.  There's not even much traffic on Sundays.   There really is no safe shortcut for bikes to take to avoid that strip because taking the earlier right on to Albany Street is also dangerous.

It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes. The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride. What you observed was the patch down in binder awaiting the final top course. The patches are scheduled to be topped within a week. Any questions you call the City Engineer Tom Mougamian. 617-304-7308. I hope the explanation clarified your concerns. The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.
