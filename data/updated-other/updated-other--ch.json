It is difficult to cross in the crosswalk(s) safely since drivers are often not willing/able to stop for pedestrians. Can the crosswalks be better marked or patrolled?\n\n2.  The intersection of South Street at Guernsey Street, Roslindale. \nThere are school bus stops along this section of SOUTH St.  Drivers use excessive speed when exiting Centre Street onto (the much narrower and pedestrian route) South Street.
