According to city regulations, noise level standards vary depending on whether the noise occurs in a residential, business, or industrial district. In residential zones, 60 decibels is the average maximum allowed during the daytime and, on average, 50 decibels at all other times. Anything above existing limits is \"noise pollution,\" a state defined as anything that can cause temporary or permanent hearing loss or be otherwise harmful; is a nuisance or \"interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life and property,\" the regulations state. Construction work, however, is largely exempt from these noise maximums. There is a city ordinance that says no construction can happen outside of 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, without an emergency need or a variance from the city's Inspectional Services Division to do work.","requested_datetime":"2015-04-24T06:42:20-04:00","updated_datetime":"2015-04-29T11:36:30-04:00","address":"416\u2013418 Rutherford Ave, Boston","lat":42.37935053099459,"long":-71.07107908479031,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/553a1e010485f28c3173ea89/report.jpg"},

The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) investigated and determined the following:. The fire pipe service at 340 Dorchester Av ruptured and damaged both the adjacent roadway and sidewalk. The property owners hired Walsh Corp to make the necessary repairs. The fire pipe has been repaired and Walsh has retained the services of two sub contractors who regularly perform permanent sidewalk and roadway repairs for the City. The roadway is scheduled to be done this week. Walsh Corp borrowed barricades from Feeney Brothers to protect the work site. The Contractor could have done a better job in maintaining the barricades while repairs were being made. The CIU instructed him to weigh down the barricades and monitor the conditions of the barricades daily. The CIU will also inspect the location daily as well. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.
