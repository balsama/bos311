My request is that the workers clearly mark perimeter of the area that they intend to work on in order to free up some parking for the residents. \n\nWe had gas line construction on our street this past summer and Feeney Brothers was extremely courteous by clearly marking the spaces they would be working on the following day.

Reported Sunday but no ticket appears to have been issued.  \n\nThe city website https://www.boston.gov/departments/parking-clerk/tips-avoiding-parking-tickets states that \u201cYou can\u2019t park a car within 20 feet of an intersection, unless it\u2019s at a metered parking spot.\u201d\n\nIt is clearly less than 10 feet from the intersection.  Not to mention it is parked facing the opposite direction of traffic.  Being under a stop sign it poses even more of a danger as motorists are less inclined to see the sign.  On a night like Halloween where there is increased foot traffic that danger only increases.","requested_datetime":"2017-10-31T04:58:34-04:00","updated_datetime":"2017-10-31T08:52:48-04:00","address":"Intersection Of Lasell St & Temple St, West Roxbury","lat":42.28660278703008,"long":-71.16997640234882},
