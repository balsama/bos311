Other | Details: I was looking for assistance with a regular parking issue at our residence (129 / 133 Stanwood Street, Dorchester, 02121). We are finding that over the past few months we are dealing with individuals who are making it extremely difficult to get out of our driveway by parking right at the edge of the curb (and at times across half of the sidewalk). This combined with the fact that Stanwood St is a narrow street to begin with, and the residents across street park their vehicle directly across from our driveway; it is incredibly hard and at times impossible to either exit the driveway or enter it as there is no room in which to maneuver. We have on occasion been forced to exit the driveway to the right (against the one-way traffic) and then reverse down to Laredo Street as we could not turn left. We have politely asked numerous times for them not to park so close to the end of the driveway, but are met with rudeness, and ignorance. I am particularly concerned regarding my in-laws one of whom is disabled and has had several health scares recently, would be unable to get out in the case of an emergency or to attend her appointments. I have noticed that it is a common issue on our street, and a few houses further down have tow zone / no parking signs that cover their driveway. What would be the first steps in acquiring something like this to help us?
