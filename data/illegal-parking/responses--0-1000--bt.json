PLEASE TICKET!! They never learn and they will continue to park all day and night making it extremely difficult and sometimes impossible to leave! We have work and things to do please come enforce it takes 2 minutes to write a ticket! If not police send BTD or someone it's ridiculous because we can't tow since it's technically on the street so it's the city of Boston's issue until it's tagged!! All we're asking is that you tag cars in a timely manner so we can tow them if necessary. I think waiting over 8 hours or even days is crazy! They are parked illegally!. Also if there's a way to let us know how to make this easier. Maybe we can get a no parking sign so we can simply call the tow truck ourselves because every time we submit on here or call it's almost never resolved. Of course the area is clear 10 hours later or the next day like obviously.","requested_datetime":"2018-06-09T05:00:51-04:00","updated_datetime":"2018-06-11T00:34:57-04:00","address":"9 Jerome St, Dorchester","lat":42.31474060103515,"long":-71.06513287878695,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/5b1b97347505ec2570d91f77/report.jpg"},
