The City of Boston has partnered with Zipcar and Enterprise CarShare to bring 80 new car-share vehicles to Boston through the DriveBoston program. Planners from the Transportation Department visited a range of locations and selected places with the largest benefit for residents that had the smallest impact on street operations and parking. The program will place vehicles in dedicated spaces around the City, including many that are currently underserved by car-share options. The majority of the spaces will be in City-owned municipal parking lots (49 spaces), with the remaining 31 spots being placed on street corners. The location of spaces were chosen by examining car registrations per household, average household mileage per day, the proximity to MBTA stations as well as Hubway stations, Main Street districts and coordination with Zipcar and Enterprise CarShare. Roxbury received 12 spots and Dorchester received 10 spots. Jamaica Plain received eight spots and the additional spots were distributed in small numbers across the City. The program spaces are all visible on an online map at boston.gov/driveboston. The DriveBoston program has three main goals: (1) create \"mobility hubs\" at key MBTA stations and along bus routes to strengthen the City's transportation network; (2) reduce the number of private vehicles per household which should relieve parking pressure; and (3) better connect the Main Street Business Districts. Data collected about how frequently people use the vehicles and for what purposes will help inform the City's transportation planners on the success of the program. National studies on the impact of car-share programs have shown significant, positive impacts.  Expanding car-share in a city, for example, can help reduce local greenhouse gas emissions.
