Caller wrote in original case \"Two illegally parked vehicles at Handicapped parking area. BOTH vehicles have ticket books placed on their windshields to avoid receiving tickets. This is insanely frustrating that City Workers would abuse the parking system and have a city-wide parking pass. It is wholly unfair to the rest of the population who must rely on finding legal street parking, or using public transit to commute to work. It is also unfair to the folks who rely on these handicap parking spaces because they are unable to use other means. For the system to work, everyone must follow the same rules & regulations. Abusing the system builds resent toward city workers from the general population and sheds a bad light on government employees, whom we should be admiring for their civic duties.

Other | Details: This is my third time reporting this problem over the last several months. There is ZERO enforcement and ZERO improvement. Please escalate this notice to a higher command: Along the entire length of Lagrange Street in downtown Boston cars and trucks park on the sidewalk all day every day. Not only are these vehicles parked with two wheels on the sidewalk, the area is a No Parking zone anyway. Ergo, there should be NO vehicles parked here at any time, certainly not on the sidewalk. There is a large construction project on Lagrange Street and many of these illegally parked cars belong to the jerks who work on the site. The police details not only don't care about the illegally parked cars, they encourage it. One officer claimed that he's in charge of the street and he'll decide where people park. Ridiculous. At night more cars park on the sidewalk, presumably parked by people visiting local bars. There is no relief! Again, this is my third time notifying the city about this. I have been told by the DOT that they will increase enforcement in this area but clearly this is not the case. I expect the police detail to enforce the laws, why else are they there but to keep the area safe during construction? What a bunch of lazy cops. And I ask the DOT to ticket and tow every car parked on the sidewalk or other no parking zones. There is no other solution but 100% enforcement every day. | Type of vehicle: Car | Make: Acura | Model: 2DR | Color: Black","requested_datetime":"2013-01-03T13:15:19-05:00","updated_datetime":"2013-01-03T13:59:59-05:00","address":"Intersection of Allen's Aly and Tremont St and Lagrange St, Boston, MA","lat":42.35167898226776,"long":-71.06472472225768},
