Two residents in the immediate vicinity have sold in the past year due to the noise and harassment. It is not fair to people who actually live and pay taxes in the city to not have parking, or have dozens of motorcycles blocking the street, and revving engines and setting off car alarms until 3 and 4am on weekends. The police do nothing when there are a crowd of 50 people just gathered on the sidewalk. No doubt if they were Latino or black this would end up with many arrests, but a white criminal gang gets a free pass.
