Since last week and they have had valet parking outside of the restaurant at 750 Adams St. taking up free parking spot and basically forcing people to valet their cars because they have signs for valet and they keep blocking the spots with cones. \nThey do not have any valet parking signs at all anywhere in this area so how are they allowed to have valet parking from Boston valet without proper signage. This is the second time in a week but I've tried to park but have not had anywhere to park due to them putting signs out in the street blocking the parking spots. This business should be fined and this should not be allowed. There are several other restaurants along Adams Street and none of them have ever had valet parking. This is Dorchester not downtown Boston. Something needs to be done to stop this immediately this is ludicrous. I saw one of your offices tell them last week that they could not do this and he remove the cones and the signs and put them on the sidewalk. As soon as he drove away I watch them put the cones back into the street and block the spots again.","requested_datetime":"2017-06-19T17:22:54-04:00","updated_datetime":"2017-06-29T08:56:40-04:00","address":"Intersection Of Delmont St & Adams St, Dorchester","lat":42.28592852510763,"long":-71.05482271215396,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/594840a204854749cd8fbcdc/report.jpg"},
