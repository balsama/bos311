Other | Details: The parking issues exist on both Nikisch and Beech streets. General parking problems, due in part to possibly illegal renting/overcrowding (see separate complaint regarding 281 beech st) Residents and visitors regularly park cars too close together which prevents other residents from both parking near their own home and being able to move their car out of a legal spot. Often the parking is so congested that people routinely block fire hydrants and ignore the 20 foot distance from curb (for fire apparatus) access. In addition, residents routinely park facing the wrong way (on Nikisch st - against the oncoming traffic.) This has been a serious problem for a long time. I have lived here for 14 years and witnessed many accidents, near accidents and confrontations between drivers. Nikisch is wide enough for parking on both sides, however due to the fact that the street is regulary used as a short cut to avoid washington st, the traffic on this street is very busy which causes other problems as well.","requested_datetime":"2012-09-29T19:00:50-04:00","updated_datetime":"2012-10-01T10:07:34-04:00","address":"Intersection of Beech St and Nikisch Ave, Roslindale, MA","lat":42.27946514802925,"long":-71.1388153028319},

Double parked | Details: Topic: smooth flow of traffic at a major downtown location, Stuart St at Tremont St, particularly during rush hour; illegal parking done (for years) with the assistance of W Hotel valet parking folks. I have driven by this location most weekday mornings since 2008, usually 7:30-9 am. Very often, perhaps a third of the time, there are cars parked illegally in front of W Hotel. This morning, at 10 am sharp, there were three! At the curb, the full block's length in front of the hotel, there is a lane for parking and taxis; no complaint about that. The next lane away from the curb is a full traffic lane. Often, there are cars double-parked in this full traffic lane. Sometimes, the parking/cab lane is full, so they permit double-parking; however, it remains illegal and improper. W Hotel may need more quickly to valet park (elsewhere) the cars that are taking up parking space in the parking lane, so they have more open spots (or ask drivers to circle the block). Cars are double-parked not simply for a few seconds, but often for many minutes. That is selfish, improper, illegal and unsafe. Traffic is forced to merge a full lane to the left around the double-parked cars, and then immediately back to the right since the traffic lane is by then a \"right turn only\" lane. Other times, double-parking goes on even when there IS space in the parking/cab lane! It seems the valet personnel allow this simply to make it luxurious for whoever was driving to hop out of his or her car fast. This more flagrant violation is even more egregious. In just 10 minutes (around 11:10 am, 8 August 2012), I took the three submitted photos. In the first two, there are two different W Hotel valet personnel helping/assisting drivers to double-park in the traffic lane. In the final photo, there are two double-parked cars in the traffic lane alongside several available parking spaces in the parking lane.

Resident parking spot | Details: This happens every weekend. On Sunday July 8th at one point I saw 2 cars with NY plates and 1 Maine plate and one NH plate. The entire area is all resident parking and none of them get tickets. It is tough for us who do have resident permits and follow the rules because then we can do simple things like unload groceries or just park in the area that was designated for us so instead we have to park a few blocks away and walk with our groceries. It would be nice to have something on the citizens connect app for illegal parkers that we could take a photo and send it in for them to get a ticket.

Resident parking spot | Details: I am NOT here to submit a parking lot violation, but this is the closest thing I could find. I am here to complain about the fact that Charlestown High School staff have been provided with an insufficient number of parking spaces, and as a result, some of us are ticketed. Teachers are issued permits for 3 parking lots \u2013 1 parking lot behind the Charlestown Community Center, and 2 parking lots off of Walford Way, in the Charlestown BHA development. These parking arrangements were made with the city because the city knows that there is not enough designated parking for the staff at CHS, and even those arrangements are not enough \u2013 and the city must know this, because they have records of how many staff work at CHS and how many spaces are in each lot. This is a problem of city employees that the city is solving on paper but not in reality. These lots are not exclusively reserved for teachers - they are shared with Charlestown residents - and every day, they are full. Behind the community center, the lot fills past capacity every day, with at least 7 cars squeezing into strips of pavement not designated as parking spaces. Any day that I am able to claim one of these spaces, I do so knowing that I am displacing one colleague who will have to park outside our designated area and risk being fined for parking at work. Sometimes, I am the displaced one, and I'll wave to other teachers who are in the same boat for the day, parking on Medford Street as I\u2019m getting out of my own Medford Street space. And we are receiving tickets. I have received 5 tickets already this year - that's $100 I'm being asked to pay for 5 days of parking. This is ridiculous. We are not hotshots demanding to park wherever we please: we just need to get to park at work without worrying about paying $20 a day for parking - that's $3600 for a 180-day school year - even when the city has not provided us with enough spaces. | Type of vehicle: Car | Details: Please see above.

Other | Details: This is a really repeated thing happennig over and over. The Paradise Club on Comm Ave is constantly blocking the bike lane with tour buses of the bands performing there. It has become a very well known dangerous spot for people who use the bicycle as a regular form of transportation around the city. I have talked with someone from the Paradise club about this and they claim that the city hall parking authority is granting them permission to use the bike lane for parking as well. My gut instinct suspects that if this is true it would indicate on the reserved parking signs handed to them from the parking authority which it does not. want to ask that if the parking authority really does care about the safety of others on the road. PLEASE either stop put up a warning sign for the bicyclers to let them know about this or stop issuing parking permits to these tours buses.
