{"service_request_id":"101002177848","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. Utility companies and private contractors obviously need permission (permits) from any City or Town to perform work on their streets. Depending on the scope of the work the permit may be for a few days, or a couple of months. They are required to post the street 48 hours before the work takes place. The sign indicates the dates of work allowed on the permit. The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) realized in many cases the work maybe much less than the permit states, or they are moving down the street and not spending all the permitted time at that location. When a resident sees  30, 60, or 90 days on the sign it absolutely creates an instant overwhelming feeling of inconvenience in their minds. Where are they going to find parking for that amount of time? Again, instead the work maybe only a few days in front of the residence. This is why we tell the permittees that we want you as best as you can to only indicate the dates you are going to be working.  If you need a few extra days, then you change the dates. Seeing 3 days or 5 days or 7 days is a lot easier to handle than the 30, 60, or 90 days. In this particular instance, we will talk to the contractor about the 6:00am start.  Depending on the location and the need, sometimes work can begin before 7:00am. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.
