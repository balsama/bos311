Other | Details: I commute to Boston College on bike and everyday cars park illegally in the bike lane on Beacon St near House Rd outbound and between Stone Ave and Acacia Ave inbound. This is very dangerous to myself and other riders because we are forced into the traffic lane where the road narrows near BC and during rush hour this is very frightening. Also, heading outbound there are significant potholes in the road which are extremely hard to see in low light when suddenly pushed into the main flow of traffic due to illegibly parked cars. I have noticed this problem since the Fall, but assumed there must have been some sort of exception to the clearly posted \"Tow Zone\" signs, but I recently checked and find no exceptions. I phoned the Boston Police today who told me to call 911 and report, however, not wanting to clog up the line with non-emergency, I phoned BC police, who recommended I contact this department. I also emailed the bike contact for the city who referred me to the police. I appreciate your help very much as Boston is a very stressful place to bike, though it's getting better! The bike lanes are helpful (though they are in the \"door\" zone of parked cars) and when cars do not respect them it puts both bikers and motorists at risk for accidents. Lastly, this is all occurring on the Boston side of the town line which runs through BC.

Other | Details: . To Whom It May Concern: .. I am writing to put you on notice that the marked bike lanes along both sides of Columbus Avenue between the Ruggles T stop and Dartmouth Street are currently blocked by numerous parked vehicles. I am writing to request that you rectify this dangerous situation for bike commuters and riders and ensure a safe and functioning bike lane along that stretch of Columbus Ave. ... It does not appear that the Boston Transportation Department is currently ticketing these illegally parked vehicles. In many instances there are cars and trucks (including commercial vehicles) completely straddling and blocking the bike lane and even partially blocking the adjacent car lane. Of course this situation forces those of us riding our bikes on Columbus Ave to ride in the middle of the single remaining car lane thereby creating a dangerous and frustrating situation for both bike riders and cars traveling along Columbus Ave. ... I understand there is still a fair amount of snow and ice along the curb in this area such that it might be difficult for vehicles parking on Columbus to completely avoid the bike lane. However, it is now March and significant amounts of snow and ice have melted. It has also been a long time since the last major snowstorm. Given the City's concerted efforts to improve the Boston's reputation for bike accessibility and bike safety, I would think the City would not tolerate this flagrant disregard for parking regulations and dangerous situation for bike commuters and riders. My view of the cars parking in that area is that if you give them an inch they will take a mile! Don't you think it is time to start ticketing these illegally parked vehicles or take some other action to ensure clear and safe bike lanes? .. Please respond and let me know if there is anything you can do to address this dangerous situation. .. Thank you kindly for your anticipated response. ..

There is a car parked on that side a couple houses north of Ormond St. It has been there since before the first of the January blizzards, and is now mostly buried in snow and ice. Year-round, I frequently see other cars parked on that side when taking my kids to & from the Young Achievers School. That street is very narrow, is used by schoolbuses and garbage trucks, and is very busy during YA's drop-off and dismissal times (including before & after school). Now, with so much snow on both sides of the street, and people parking poorly and/or illegally because of it, it can be *extremely* difficult to pass another car. Parking officers need to monitor this street more regularly, and enforce the parking rules here. (Also, the intersection of Wellington Hill St & Blue Hill Ave needs to be plowed more thoroughly. The bottom of Wellington Hill is steep, and gets very slippery when it snows. And right now, the snow blocks part of the lane, so that turning left onto W.H. from northbound Blue Hill often requires going over the stop-line for southbound traffic.) | Type of vehicle: Car | Details: White car, buried in snow and ice | Make: Unknown | Model: 4DR | Color: White","requested_datetime":"2011-02-01T08:44:32-05:00","updated_datetime":"2011-02-02T11:16:06-05:00","address":"Intersection of Wellington Hill St and Ormond St, Mattapan, MA","lat":42.27983741084308,"long":-71.09361108333307},

This is taking place behind The Times restaurant and bar off Broad St next to the Greeway and the Surface Road. Although Massport put up no parking signs and fenced off the area to deter parking, the fences have been taken down and the flower planters have been moved to allow parking by staff and contractors even though they are 20 feet from an operating parking lot. Most serious is that cars and delivery vans and contractors trucks routinely drive right down the middle of the sidewalk to access this no parking area. I walk that sidewalk everyday and overlook the the area from my office and routinely see pedestrians get out of the way of trucks and autos heading right down the middle of the sidewalk. Yesterday I saw a Mercedes-Benz drive the length of the sidelwalk from India Street to pick up a person at the back door of The Times. They continued down the sidewalk and reentered the street at Broad St. Today a delivery van drives down the sidewalk to deliver to the back door of The Times - mostly blocking the sidewalk.

This causes residents of the street to park on the \"house\" side of street leading to the second issue... 2. The street is too narrow for parking on both sides. Cars should not be allowed to park on the \"house\" side of street because it leads to dangerous situation for people walking or children playing in the area. The cars that park on the \"house\" side of the street are also forced to pull up ON the sidewalk, because the street is so narrow, and there are already cars parked on opposite \"track\" side of the street. **Please consider posting NO PARKING signs on the \"house\" side of Prescott St. **Also please begin enforcing the posted \"2 hour\" parking limit on the \"track\" side of Prescott St., so that actual resident of the neighborhood can use this parking, instead of the purple line commuters that currently ignore the sign and abuse this free parking all day.

Brookline St. | How is the car parked illegally? Double parked | Details: I live at 411 Shawmut Ave\u2014right across from Blackstone Square and sandwiched between the Salvation Army Harbor Light Center and St. Stephen\u2019s Episcopal Church. We\u2019ve been here for well over a year now, and we continue to have problems with St. Stephen\u2019s church and their parishioners\u2019 parking. Every Saturday morning, for hours and hours, church-goers double park their vehicles on Shawmut Ave, blocking in residents\u2019 cars. I\u2019ve attached some pictures to give you an idea. We\u2019ve tried the obvious neighborly things to do. We spoke with Vicar Tim Crellin at the church, and that was a dead end. Because the church is rented to an Ethiopian Orthodox congregation on Saturday\u2019s, he took no responsibility and made it clear that it was not his problem. Although Saturday tends to be worse than Sunday, this doesn\u2019t address the problem with his own congregation on Sunday. We also tried to talk with the Ethiopian Orthodox congregation leaders, and they insist they have a standing permit to double park. They said if we need our vehicle, we should ask the ushers to disturb the Mass to have people move their cars. That\u2019s obviously inconvenient for us and for them. So, several months ago, when we were parked in (again), we contacted the Mayor\u2019s hotline. We managed to get BTD out here on a Saturday, but they wouldn\u2019t tow vehicles. Instead, they asked the church-goers to move them. Fortunately, they did, but as soon as the BTD left, the cars returned. So, tt continues to happen every Saturday...and it's getting worse. We\u2019re at our wits end with handling this. We have made it a point never to park on that section of the street on a weekend for fear of being blocked in. Is there anything that can be done to enforce the parking rules and eliminate this problem? | Type of vehicle: Other | Make: Unknown | Model: Unknown | Color: Unknown","requested_datetime":"2009-10-03T10:53:43-04:00","updated_datetime":"2009-10-09T16:20:22-04:00","address":"411 Shawmut Ave, Roxbury, MA, 02118","lat":42.340409999896636,"long":-71.07389000000785},

Also as per Case Number 101000080910 nothing was done to correct the \"old sign\" designating this no-parking space, which is unclear and needs to be revised, as visitors to Alberta Street park here whenever Mr. Hartigan's cars are not there. Please do something to make clear that this is a NO PARKING space, I'm sure your office has plenty of appropriate signs for this for example \"NO Parking here to corner\" or NO PARKING TOW ZONE\", and paint a yellow curb to ensure visitors know this is NOT a legal parking space.
