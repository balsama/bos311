I saw them pull up today and pull an old ticket from inside the van and stick it on the windshield. It would be nice to see some more enforcement on warren between pembroke and w canton street. The street is being overrun by commercial vehicles that sit in resident spots all day long without getting ticketed. They leave the trucks double parked and you cant find them to get your car out. They leave vehicles running all day long. Now they are trying to cheat using fake tickets. Also on w canton street at montgomery a truck sits parked in the crosswalk every single day and never gets a ticket. The old church at 190 warren also has construction trucks double parked all along the street all day. They block the sidewalk and people have to walk down the middle of the street which isn't fun with all of the snow this winter. Anyway it would be nice to see a little more enforcement around here. With all of the snow parking is tough enough in this neighborhood and illegally parked commercial vehicles are just making it tougher. | Type of vehicle: Van | Make: Unknown | Model: 2DR | Color: RedOrange | Vehicle License Plate Registration: P10872 | Vehicle License Plate State: MA","requested_datetime":"2014-02-19T07:43:38-05:00","updated_datetime":"2014-02-19T09:41:04-05:00","address":"200 Warren Ave, Apt 1, Roxbury, MA, 02118","lat":42.343459999996206,"long":-71.07702999998763},
