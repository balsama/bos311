Can the city either put up temporary no parking signs so that no one blocks their ability to plow that area when they can get to it? That's what was done the last big storm we had and it helped.

Since a \"residents only\" restriction during the days has been placed on our street, it makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for service people, work people, friends, or family to come and reliably be able to park near our house without getting ticketed. \n\nWhy doesn't Jamaica Plain issue guest parking Passes like other neighborhoods? Considering we have only on street parking for our single-family house, and none guaranteed at that, having anyone to our house during the day becomes very difficult at best, unless they want to risk getting ticketed. Please issue guest parking passes to residents, at least 1 per household.","requested_datetime":"2018-01-06T13:17:34-05:00","updated_datetime":"2018-01-06T18:51:53-05:00","address":"Intersection Of Patten St & Wachusett St, Jamaica Plain","lat":42.29428694695068,"long":-71.11621716457027},

Car should have been towed so the plows could clear the street. I submitted request but nothing big was ever done and it was closed out. So the car is still there today without even a ticket on it and there's nowhere to park on the street  because the trucks couldn't plow because of this one car. Please ticket and tow and bring a truck back to plow park street so there's somewhere for residents to park.\n\nThanks","requested_datetime":"2018-01-05T19:32:08-05:00","updated_datetime":"2018-01-05T19:32:00-05:00","address":"20 Park St, Charlestown","lat":42.37269143858784,"long":-71.0612055731834,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/5a5018ef04850018608a13f9/report.jpg"},
