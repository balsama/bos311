Other | Details: This car MA 2SZ370 White 4 door station wagon van with windows all around has been parked in front of 349 Meridian St. for 7 days now 24 hours a day without moving. It is full of food and trash. The owner of the Canton Eatery 339 Meridian St. leaves it and has been doing it for months again. This address is being renovated to new condo's and last week he stomped down the sidewalk hollering at the workers there that they cannot park there vehicles there. As soon as they moved their cars and working trucks he moved all his and employees vehicles there and didn't move them until after 2am the next day. He parks two of his vehicles right in front of his store No Parking/15 min. posted signs opening the trunk on one and side door on another making it look like they are unloading stock but these cars stay parked for hours at a time. There is normally 4-5 of the owners/workers cars parked from 11am-4am the next morning parked illegally. He has cars towed and threatens people that park in front of his store. When all the parking spots are taken he double parks his and the takeout vehicles all day and night blocking the bicycle lane and all outbound traffic. This causes an extreme danger to the bike riders, MBTA buses that have to cross over into oncoming traffic and pedestrians. Not to mention all the road rage, horn honking and hollering. He has been getting away with this for years and has been reported multiple times with zero results. We don't understand why he hasn't and does not get cited for this.
