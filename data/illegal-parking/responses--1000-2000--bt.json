On this particular day, we ran out of the car to drop off flower arrangements for a friend and came back to the car within 10 minutes, plus I had a toddler so it always takes a little longer of course! When I pulled up, the sign simply said, \"commercial plates only\" and no other description. Reading this sign to me means, if you have a commercial plate, then you can park here and I have one. It said nothing about having signage or lettering on the side of the truck, if it had stated that on the parking sign, I would have kept looking for parking, but the sign was written so simply - commercial plates, period.... I already paid the $55.00 and now I owe a late payment because I was trying to get a hold of Boston to fight this, so we sent the payment in and it arrived two days late.
