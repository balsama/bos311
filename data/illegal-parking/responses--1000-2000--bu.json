You can see plate # in photo if you zoom in. The lane that was put there specifically because Mass Ave has been identified as a particularly treacherous route for cyclists and a cyclist was killed when a truck cut the corner and the back wheels crossed into the bike lane crushing her. Creating that bike lane with a painted buffer guides large vehicles around the bike lane when they make the turn. Having a truck parked in it defeats the purpose and endangers cyclists as they move into the traffic lane to avoid it. I stopped and spoke to the driver, who was polite, but his first reaction to the fact that I stopped to talk to him was to ask me if I was having a bad day. I had to explain to him why it was so important that he not park there. I think this point needs to be reiterated to city workers who, perhaps correctly so, believe they can park illegally as they do their work. They just really need to keep the bike lanes clear. It is about saving lives.","requested_datetime":"2016-12-13T10:06:39-05:00","updated_datetime":"2016-12-13T12:03:10-05:00","address":"Intersection Of Massachusetts Ave & Columbus Ave, Roxbury","lat":42.34061166666667,"long":-71.08160283333333,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/58500e770485b8e8d344e15a/report.jpg"},
