Other | Details: Several weeks ago, a lot of work was done on North Harvard Street - it was repaved, a bike lane was installed on both sides and the yellow stripes were re-done to reflect the 'new' driving lanes for vehicles. However, the signage was not changed - there were some temporary paper 'No Parking\" signs put up but now the same tons of cars are parking IN the bike lanes. On 8/5/09 there were 15 cars parked at 8:00 am; on 8/14/09 there were 27 cars parked at 8 am; on 8/15/09 there were 28 cars parked at 10 am; and today there were already 28 cars parked there at 8:10 am (and this is only on one side of the street - I imagine it is the same on the other side of the street towards Storrow Drive as well). It is VERY difficult driving now as the yellow striping for the driving lanes is not accurate with all these vehicles parked in the bikes lanes. The bikes are still in the driving lanes. It was my understanding that these new areas would be 'no parking zones' but if someone is not enforcing the towing for no parking, the road will never work the way it should. The illegally parked cars should be towed each and every day until people realize that this is no longer 'free parking'. The bike lanes need to be painted to reflect that they are bike lanes. It seems a shame to spend all that $$$ fixing the road and setting up bike lanes to not have them usable due to people who are continuing to park illegally. I realize that this is an ongoing problem, but it needs to be addressed. Once college starts in the fall, the problem will only increase.

Other | Details: Street Cleaning | Type of vehicle: Car | Details: I just moved to the area and my mom was at my house waiting for the repair man to come. She looked out of the window and noticed that the tow truck was getting ready to tow her car. She went out to find a ticket on her car due to street cleaning. She was then told that her car was about to be towed due to street cleaning. She says to them why would you tow my car after you have given me a ticket and the tow truck driver's response was to tell Menino. I think that it is a little excessive to not only give a ticket for $40 but to also tow a persons car for street cleaning and expect them to pay $150 to get their car out of tow. This is ridiculous!!! I had lived on my previous street for 15 years and not once was a persons car towed for street cleaning. Why would you all expect someone to pay over $200 for street cleaning. Times are hard and this is not right. Ok give a ticket but don't tow people cars. ONLY TICKETS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUT NOT TOWING FOR STREET CLEANING. Then to top it off, you all need to put up signs that say your car will be towed if you park on street cleaning, but it doesn't and on the sign you can barely tell what day street cleaning is because the day and time on the sign are worn to the point that they are barely visible. | Vehicle License Plate State: MA","requested_datetime":"2009-06-05T14:29:39-04:00","updated_datetime":"2009-06-10T14:07:38-04:00","address":"1 City Hall Plz, Boston, MA, 02114","lat":42.36065792105362,"long":-71.05801552215273},

Dartmouth Street | How is the car parked illegally? Other | Please provide details: Hi- My office is located in Copley Square (Boston Marathon finish line) and I've noticed over the past few months the following: 1. Detail cops parking in metered spaces with ticket books, uniforms in windows and tickets on the windshield. (nothing new, they do this all the time) 2. Up to 8 cars/pick-up trucks associated with the Copley T station construction site parked the entire day in metered spaces with no tickets and seemingly approved by the detail cop. I sent complaints to the Mayor's office and the chief of police but I never heard anything back. I complained that the cop's private car(s) should not be able to park free in metered spaces (loss revenue) and also the cops and meter maids were setting a horrible example to the public for allowing numerous construction vehicles to park throughtout the day which is against the traffic and parking laws.

Rutland/Shawmut | How is the car parked illegally? Other | Please provide details: Hello-- I am a constituent in the South End. I received a call from my neighbor last week telling me my car was being towed from its legal parking spot on Rutland St. two blocks from my home. My license plate is MA 159 FHO. I was very upset to hear this, as I had been careful to park in a no-tow spot as I was leaving town for ten days. I knew I would be returning this Thursday (today), the first street cleaning day on our street. So I looked long and hard before finding the spot on the Monday street cleaning side on Rutland St. It took several calls to the Police tow line and BTD before finding out why my car was towed. It was supposedly a \"construction\" site, although there was absolutely no signage to indicate this when I parked my car there on March 23. I have been making calls to everyone at Boston police and city hall to try to resolve this error, to no avail. The Tow Line suggested I call my local police station's \"tow liaison\". The officer who answered the phone was rude, and laughed at me saying there was no such thing as a tow liaison. I called the Mayor's constituent line. They said that I should call the local police station back and ask for an auto officer. I did so and the same rude policewoman refused to talk to me and sent me back to the tow line. I called the Mayor's office again and they said there was nothing that could be done, short of appealing to the city clerk. Even then, the operator said, I probably wouldn't get my money back. This is extremely frustrating. My car is currently racking up overnight charges at Bostonian Tow lot in Brighton and I am out of town with no recourse. I don't feel I should come back, have to go to the police station and then to the tow lot and pay hundreds of dollars to release my legally parked South End-permitted car. In the meantime, I have to stay out of town longer than anticipated (until Apr. 9), meaning I'll have to pay even more. I am writing to you as a last recourse, hoping you can arbitrate this in some way on my behalf. Please advise.

However, cars are now parking on the Dead End Street making it nearly impossible to get out/or turn into the street.

It's either I'm going to hit one of the cars by accident because it's so tight, or I'm going to accidently crash into the electric pole. There's not enough clearance to turn in or pull out because cars are also parking so close to the curb on Copeland Street. Please put up a no parking sign.

Other | Please provide details: 2 HR VISITOR PARKING IS NOT BEING ENFORCED AT ALL. The neighborhood is having a problem with people taking advantage of our visitor parking. It appears that the same multiple cars are parking in these spots all day. Our permit parking is from 8AM TO 8PM so it seems that word got out that BTD does not enforce parking in our neighborhood. The biggest problem is mostly from 102 to 108 Hammond St on Both sides of the street. We also have the same problems on other streets in our very small neighborhood. The other 2 hr visitor parking problems is a problem on Greenwich St and Warwick St and right behind good eats restaurant on the cobblestone area which is marked as cabot street but its technically Tremont st. The cars there park for days and its usually a lot of outer state plates that park there every day. At the corner of Hammond and Tremont from about 8p.m. and on each night behind the bus stop there cars park on the sidewalk and the cobblestone area behind the bus stop which is park of the SIDEWALK. Again this is not enforced at all. We had commissioner Tinlin here awhile ago and he acknowledged our parking problems. He had a few cars towed that day and that was the most service that we have gotten for our problems from BTD. We don't want to call him again so we are kind of begging that this area gets enforced. At night it just looks like a bomb hit the area with cars not to mention if we need to use the sidewalks or someone is in a wheelchair.It's a big problem and feel free to call me regarding this matter.
