Resident parking spot | Details: Good morning this email is intended for parking enforcement. I have tried unsuccessfully to use the 311 app. I phoned 311 and spoke with a lovely csr who was not able to take a request via phone as I have been informed the entire system is currently down. When your system is refreshed I hope you receive this email. Pilgrim rd is resident parking for fenway / kenmore registered vechicles. The truth is many folks park on this tertiary road to attend surrounding college functions or events at fenway Park - today's example is a Mission Hill resident. For those who have registered cars, we struggle with many obstacles and know parking close to our homes is not guaranteed. However it is disheartening to wait up to an hour for a illegally parked vehicle to leave. The attached photo was one example I took at 10:37 am today. I phoned the BTD hotline, unsuccessfully used the 311 app for both electronic submission and live call. I believe in 2016 it was cascaded to residents that we would be receiving support by increasing violations to $100 and more visible presence - I understand budgets and resources need to becontrolled but this is a constant battle - can someone please be sent today as well as part of a regular route? In the one hour I have spent this morning capturing a single photo, calling email etc, this one offender has left the Wheelock campus and removed her car but on a game day like today there are sure to be more. And unlike yesterday when I waited 45 minutes for a spot to open up, I have not counted the entire street so I can not confirm definitely how many cars are currently illegally parked, Yesterday it was 8 illegally parked cars in mid afternoon in one 45 minute time span.
