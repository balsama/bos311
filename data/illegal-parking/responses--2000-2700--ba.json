I'm trying to file a complaint on the St. Columbkille's school. Parents of the children are using ower street for drop off and pick up. I live on a dead end and on the side of the school there is no parking because the street is no wide enough. They still park there for drop off and pick up. I was informed by a parent who is also a resident that a letter went out to all the parents that they were not allowed to use ower street for drop off and pick up but still do. They block drive ways, park in the ower drive ways and congest the street. It took me almost 20 min this morning once I pulled onto my street to get to my house because it was so congested. I have a 92 year old neabor who at times needs an ambulance and because of the parents parking an ambulance or fire truck will never get to her or us.

Resident parking spot | Details: The illegal parking situation during Red Sox games has become extreme. Every time the Sox play at home the parking spaces on Gainsborough, Symphony and Hemenenway St are full of people without Fenway/Kenmore permits parking illegally. There is literally nowhere left to park for people with permits who live in that neighborhood. I have to drive around for ~30 minutes to try to find a space, and tonight I had to give up and parked in a \"Red Sox game parking lot\" where I had to pay $40. This is the exact spot where the people going to the game are supposed to park, and residents with valid stickers like me are supposed to be able to park where they are. The signs clearly say that cars parked illegally will be towed but this is not enforced. Walking back down Gainsborough St from the garage just now I counted 33 cars without stickers parked illegally on that street alone! I know you have the capability to ticket and tow these cars because they are quickly removed during street cleaning times and snow emergencies. Can you please start bringing this effort 24/7, especially during Red Sox games? I am literally unable to leave my apartment by car when the Sox are in town. You would generate enormous revenue by ticketing/towing these illegally parked cars, the law would be followed and equilibrium would be restored, is there a cause for the inaction?
