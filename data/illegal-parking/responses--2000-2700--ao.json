Unfortunately, many people park there anyway, waiting in car or just leaving it there . I live at 88 Prince and turn onto Salem often. If a car is illegally parked there, I have to back up, drive on sidewalk to make turn. Many people out walking cause a dangerous situation as cars have to back up to legally turn onto Salem.  Cars frequently park there; it's dangerous and PLEASE something has to be put there to prohibit parking.  Maybe bright yellow diagonal stripes with NO PARKING written in middle. Obviously the sign serves no purpose.  And if a cop drives by, a ticket should be issued!! I've had it!!!!!
