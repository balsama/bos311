Meanwhile, all of his tenants have been moved and the property is now for sale (It has been on redfin for eight months.) He is parking on the grass. So he has taken a spot from the city which he has towed people out of for parking there. And he parks there, on the grass, as if he's really got a driveway. I was there when he stood up at the city Council meeting and promised that he was going to live there and not sell it. His name is Brian McCarter. He has done the same thing previously with his properties in the south end.  His listing on redfin says parking is possible. He simply got the curb cut to drive up the market value of this house so he can sell it for more. No one even lives there anymore. And no one is using the parking spot because we are all afraid to get towed.
