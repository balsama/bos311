Why are the the firemen allowed to park where ever they want? Today is street cleaning and it's a \"fire lane\" not \" fireman parking only\" they have ample parking. Not only they park wherever  they wish, but they paint the sidewalk curbs ( City Property ) red. Ive been occupying the coffee shop on the corner of Hanover/Charter since 2012 and I think it's disgusting they do as they please, parking in the city is scarce enough and I think it's a slap in the face they take spots from people and get special privileges when they are given their own parking lots. Meter maid badge number 310 walked by this particular car 3 times and now the street sweeper couldn't properly clean the street due to her and the fireman's negligence!","requested_datetime":"2019-04-04T08:35:25-04:00","updated_datetime":"2019-04-04T10:26:14-04:00","address":"431 439 Hanover St, Boston","lat":42.36593134660934,"long":-71.05277265644875,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/5ca5f9f575057a454b67c49f/report.jpg"},
