Also, it has no license plate and twice I have recently seen him locking up his bike around 3 am and he was noticeably drunk or high.  On one occasion he was witnessed weaving erratically up the street and when he got off the scooter he could barely stand.  I observed this last week from 5 ft away as I was preparing for a very early departure on a fishing trip to Canada   He first drove by me weaving and then as I sat there it took him 5 minutes to lock up his bike and then he almost fell over walking down the sidewalk.  He then crossed the street in front of me and almost fell down again. I was tempted to say something but since I was leaving town I didn't want him to vandalize my place while away.
