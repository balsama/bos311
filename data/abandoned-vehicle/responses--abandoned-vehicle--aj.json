During the course of my phone call with the rep this morning, my comment / concern lost my original intent. I was calling about a lack of parking restriction enforcement on our street, not about an abandoned vehicle. For the past couple of months there have been seemingly more cars parked on our street without Dorchester Resident Stickers. To make a point with the person I was speaking to, I referred to a car that has been parked on the street for a couple of weeks w/o a sticker and seemingly without being ticketed. I would like to see greater parking enforcement on our street for residents of Dorchester, NOT initiate abandoned automobile removal proceedings.
