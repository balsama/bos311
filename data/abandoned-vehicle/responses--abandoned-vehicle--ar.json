It is located between the doors of 19 and 21 Saybrook street, in front of a snow mound and behind another unshoveled/abandoned car (black Mini Cooper, MA plate 5BNM10). It also has a broken trunk that is being held together with rope, but quite possibly has a family of small rodents taking shelter inside the open trunk. Due to the snow, the license plates are not visible, but I got the plate number from a picture I took a few months ago. In the picture the third character in the license plate is partially blocked by the rope on the trunk, so it may be incorrect.
