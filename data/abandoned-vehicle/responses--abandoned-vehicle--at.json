In this neighborhood we all know each other and if we have new cars, have a friend or family members car, we let each other know so that we watch out for each other. Also, my neighbor at 70 Byron Street is over 80 years old and we all respect that and almost always make sure that a spot is available in front of his house so that he doesn't have to walk far. Also, a third NH blue colored SUV was parked across the street from these two and has not moved all day either. It's only been a day for this one but just very suspicious. Who knows if these people are parking here and taking a cab to the airport or something so that they don't have to pay for parking. Not very fair to the residents of this street who have a very difficult time parking because many cars from Saratoga and Wordsworth Streets park on it.","requested_datetime":"2014-05-18T22:16:11-04:00","updated_datetime":"2014-05-31T11:17:36-04:00","address":"68 Byron St, East Boston, MA, 02128","lat":42.384649999914224,"long":-71.01881000029702},
