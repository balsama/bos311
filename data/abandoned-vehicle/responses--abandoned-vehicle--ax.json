In order to retrieve the vehicle, you need a release ticket from Boston Police District B2, your driver's license, and you need to pay Always Open the tow and storage fees and tow the vehicle from their lot unless it is properly registered.  I am not sure what the process would be to transfer the registration \"D85\" to you--you would have to talk to the RMV. Always Open informs me that the B2 officer that ordered the vehicle towed, also took the license plate(s).  You will need to speak to him to find out what he did with them.  I am sure that if he still has them, he would release them to you, provided that you have a valid registration for them in your name.","service_name":"Abandoned Vehicle","service_code":"4f389210e75084437f0001de","description":"Make of the abandoned car: BUICK | Model of the abandoned car: 4DR | Color of the abandoned car: BLACK | License Plate number if available: D85 | License Plate State if available: MA | Additional Details/Comments: HELLO!
