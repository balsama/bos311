Their car is disabled and leaking an oily substance They have a driveway and park their operational car there and leave their disabled car in front of my house. They live at 40 Train St. Check your google maps and you will see a driveway next to their house. So as long as the car is registered it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s disabled? The car has sat there more than 30 days. I thought cars could not stay more than 5 days without having to move. How does Section 22B (a) (of MA Administration of the Gov\u2019t) apply? \u201cwhoever abandons a motor vehicle registered or unregistered, upon any public or private way or upon any property other than his own without the permission of the owner or lesser of said property shall be fined $250 for the first abandonment and $500 for each such abandonment thereafter. Or is that a law that just doesn\u2019t get enforced in Boston?

Their car is disabled and leaking an oily substance They have a driveway and park their operational car there and leave their disabled car in front of my house. They live at 40 Train St. Check your google maps and you will see a driveway next to their house. So as long as the car is registered it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s disabled? The car has sat there more than 30 days. I thought cars could not stay more than 5 days without having to move. How does Section 22B (a) (of MA Administration of the Gov\u2019t) apply? \u201cwhoever abandons a motor vehicle registered or unregistered, upon any public or private way or upon any property other than his own without the permission of the owner or lesser of said property shall be fined $250 for the first abandonment and $500 for each such abandonment thereafter.
