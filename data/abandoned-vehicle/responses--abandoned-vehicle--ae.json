As seen in the attached picture, the front driver's side tire had been removed and the vehicle had been sitting on a tire or rim for many months now, which is a safety issue. Also, I believe that vehicles are not to be parked in one spot without being moved for such a long period, by Boston's protocols. Could this vehicle be removed by the Boston DOT at this point? Could we please also get a return response status update on this?
