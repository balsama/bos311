Some of the cars have no license plates, flat tires, etc... they also put fake parking tickets that don't even correspond with the make or model of the car to make it seem like they have already been ticketed. As a resident on the corner of gore and Parker Street, I would appreciate it if this was resolved. It's understanding if the cars actually belong to residents. However I have been dealing with this for months and it's aggravating to keep getting tickets in the area because I can't find a suitable parking spot. Mind you, one car is not the issue here.
