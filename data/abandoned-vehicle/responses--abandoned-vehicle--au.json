The van is a commercial van. It is brightly painted with clowns and cartoon characters all over it. This van continues to park on a residential street for days at a time. Parking is tight on the street and a budding streets as it is without a van occupying at least 2 spaces. It is my understanding a commercial vehicle should not be parked on a residential street overnight. Just because this is Roxbury, does not give people the right to do whatever they want in regards to their cars. This is the second time I am emailing about this van. I know others have emailed about the van's presence. The owner of the van must live in New Academy Homes. There is ample parking in the complex. Register the van and park it there. I should not have to come home and drive around my block several times before I can park in front of my house (the house I pay a mortgage on every month and taxes annually). Please help with this issue as it has become a reoccurring problems for ALL the home owners on the street.","requested_datetime":"2013-11-20T17:46:01-05:00","updated_datetime":"2013-12-19T09:41:22-05:00","address":"21-23Townsend St, Roxbury, MA, 02119","lat":42.319539999625455,"long":-71.09308999971896},
