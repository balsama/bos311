We are tolerating people parking here for a few days, to take the T to Logan, but we are noticing a new trend, with people going on long-term trips, parking here for weeks in a row, to save parking costs at Logan. We have elderly neighbors with visiting nurses on one side and a family with a newborn on the other. When someone parks in our spot, we are forced to take a neighbor's, or park on another street.
