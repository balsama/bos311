This car, a 1997-1999 Mercury Sable, was previously parked in two spots in front of 70 Horace St. It did not move for 3 weeks. I marked the tire with chalk to be sure. Now its been shifted to 74 Horace street and has a again not moved in 3 weeks. My elderly Neighbor needs it moved so that the MBTA Ride can pull up front of his home. We have left notes on the car, for the owner to move it, but the notes remained until this most resent rain storm. So It clearly is abandon. We have asked around and no one on the two blocks that make up Horace street seems to know whom it belongs to. Sorry to report this, but we need it towed. Thank you.
