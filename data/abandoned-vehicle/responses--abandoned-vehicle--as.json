Can you please get the police to address the 10 or so cars on my street that have been left buried since the first storm. One of them is even a large commercial vehicle and the city plow trucks often avoid plowing this street because it is parked on the street and is now buried in snow. That is at 23 Leicester street. It is some kind of a paint truck. Because we don't have any mandate on cars having resident stickers we get a lot of commuters and grad students parking on our narrow small one way street to take the buses into Boston. During the winter, they often leave their car buried in the snow for weeks and even months and it has clogged up our street where it is now a danger to drive. We need a resident sticker program and for people to park on one side of the road on one way streets during a snow storm so it can be cleaned properly. Thank you.","requested_datetime":"2015-02-18T16:15:25-05:00","updated_datetime":"2015-03-02T11:00:32-05:00","address":"25 27 Leicester St, Brighton","lat":42.34997000028895,"long":-71.15426000007008},
