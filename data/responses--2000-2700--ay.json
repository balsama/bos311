My partner called 911 to assist in removing the vehicle. No one came, ever. Fortunately the person who was scheduled to fly in from Munich never boarded the flight but also never called to say they had missed it either. I came home to no parking spot and no assistance from the city. Is this the new cost saving program. I arrived back after making no less than ten loops at login airport and the local residents got together to find where the person was who parked illegally in the handicapped spot as I am convinced something terrible must have happened in the interim.\nBH","requested_datetime":"2015-08-17T11:32:12-04:00","updated_datetime":"2015-08-17T11:55:10-04:00","address":"17 Harvest St, Dorchester","lat":42.32295226775326,"long":-71.05780726305308},

Fire lane | Details: Last night, 4/28, about 9pm, I called the Mayor's Hot Line and advised that 2 enormous moving trucks, one with MA plate and one with NH plate, with 1-888AIMCUBE on the side of the trucks, were parked in the fire lane directly behind the Children's Museum on Sleeper St., closest to Congress. Truck engines were running for HOURS, and parked in the wrong direction facing Seaport Blvd. Obviously causing traffic problems since Sleeper St. is a narrow street and 2 way traffic is a challenge when the street is clear! The AIM stands for Advanced Installations & Moving in Tyngsborough, MA. I contacted the Children's Museum today, and was told by their facilities manager, Marisa Lava, that the trucks were there for a move at 320 Congress St. -- at night! Probably no permit for after hours moving. And because the trucks ran their engines for HOURS, the diesel fumes went into the Museum's building. I called the Mayor's Hot Line, and it was suggested that I call the police. Not sure the police even showed up, since I could see the trucks from my condo window, and when I went to bed at 11:15, the trucks were still there. Very disappointing that the Mayor's Hot Line could not help, and the police didn't show up. When I told the drivers that they were parked in the fire lane, they used foul language and told me 'so what'. Suburban company, operating after hours, with surly drivers, parked illegally, with engines running illegally, and I'm a condo owner paying property taxes, and they essentially did exactly what they wanted to do without consequences. | Type of vehicle: Truck | Details: see above | Vehicle License Plate State: MA","requested_datetime":"2015-04-29T12:17:57-04:00","updated_datetime":"2015-04-29T12:18:00-04:00","address":"15 33 Sleeper St, Boston","lat":42.352000000308585,"long":-71.04893000016405},

Resident parking spot | Details: This van from the City of Boston (Boston Centers for Youth and Families plate # MB 1599) keeps parking on the busy sidewalk in front of the school just about every evening. I have already reported it several times already to no avail. There is no good reason whatsoever for doing that. Charles street is plenty wide. There can be large vehicles parked on both sides of the street (not on the sidewalk!) and a school bus or large truck still has plenty of space to drive thru. Parking on the sidewalk is not only illegal; it shows total disrespect for pedestrians and neighborhood residents. It also incentivize drivers to speed up on Charles St., making it dangerous for all the kids and people who walk to and from the subway station. Smarter cities (i.e. Somerville & Cambridge) spend a lot of money to narrow their street to make them more pedestrian friendly. Meanwhile in good ol Boston, we still have to teach some city employees not to park their tax-payer funded vehicle on the sidewalk.
