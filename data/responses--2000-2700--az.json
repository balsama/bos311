Other | Details: Vehicles routinely park on sidewalk in front of the School/community center | Type of vehicle: Car | Details: In recent weeks, many vehicles have been parking on the sidewalk on Charles St. . I believe that many of them are affiliated with the Cleveland community center as this behavior tend to happen after school hours. The worst offender is actually a van with community center signs on it; it is a semi-permanent fixture on this sidewalk. (See second vehicle on the attached pictures) This happens even though the street was well cleared of snow over two weeks ago, and it is now plenty wide: there can be vehicles parked on the street on both sides (not on the sidewalk!) and a school bus or large truck still has plenty of space to drive thru. Parking on the sidewalk is illegal and shows total disrespect for pedestrians and neighborhood residents. It also incentivize drivers to speed up on Charles St., making it dangerous for all the kids and people who walk to and from the subway station. Thank you.

During this period of unprecedented snow accumulation, the Boston Transportation Department has been working diligently with the Department of Public Works and other City agencies to coordinate snow removal operations and ensure that roadways are not impeded.

Handicapped parking space | Details: Details: heading on commonwealth ave(2012 comm ave through Cleveland circle ) east in Brighton towards Cleveland circle there are two lanes set for vehicles going straight. The further lane on the right is completely blocked off by parked vehicles. Usually these vehicles park legally to the right of this rightmost travel lane but due to the snow accumulation their owners have decided to park in a manner that eliminates the right most lane from use. This is in violation of Article 4 section 1 of the traffic rules and regulation for the city of Boston, specifically: 9. Upon any roadway, unless both wheels on the side of the vehicle adjacent to the curb are within one (1\u2019) foot of the curb or edge of the roadway, except where angle parking is permitted or commercial vehicles, as defined, are permitted to back to the curb or edge of the roadway. 10. Upon any roadway where the parking of a vehicle will not leave a clear and unobstructed lane at least ten (10\u2019) feet wide on a one-way street and twenty (20\u2019) feet wide on a two-way street for passing traffic. 11. In excess of one (1) vehicle width from the curb or edge of a roadway. These regulations can be found at http://www.cityofboston.gov/images_documents/Traffic%20Rules%20and%20Regulations_tcm3-1654.pdf These parked vehicles do not have the right to obstruct traffic because their normal parking area is snow covered.

Usually these vehicles park legally to the right of this rightmost travel lane but due to the snow accumulation their owners have decided to park in a manner that eliminates the right most lane from use. This is in violation of Article 4 section 1 of the traffic rules and regulation for the city of Boston, specifically: 9. Upon any roadway, unless both wheels on the side of the vehicle adjacent to the curb are within one (1\u2019) foot of the curb or edge of the roadway, except where angle parking is permitted or commercial vehicles, as defined, are permitted to back to the curb or edge of the roadway. 10. Upon any roadway where the parking of a vehicle will not leave a clear and unobstructed lane at least ten (10\u2019) feet wide on a one-way street and twenty (20\u2019) feet wide on a two-way street for passing traffic. 11. In excess of one (1) vehicle width from the curb or edge of a roadway. These regulations can be found at http://www.cityofboston.gov/images_documents/Traffic%20Rules%20and%20Regulations_tcm3-1654.pdf These parked vehicles do not have the right to obstruct traffic because their normal parking area is snow covered. It created bottlenecks of traffic at all times and is a clear violation of the above cited law.","requested_datetime":"2015-02-11T11:47:52-05:00","updated_datetime":"2015-02-11T12:44:56-05:00","address":"Intersection Of Brookline Ave & Riverway, Boston","lat":42.33629294466131,"long":-71.1100590913554},
