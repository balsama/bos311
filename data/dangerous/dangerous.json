The diversions clearly favor traffic over pedestrians, who are by a magnitude the largest users of that area. The diversion for the sidewalk reconstruction at Bank of America building, by the bus stop, forces pedestrians into awkward, potential dangerous crossing situation. You should have a protected lane on the north side (Bank of America) of the street for pedestrians, while temporarily banning any commercial traffic from stopping on the opposite side (they can use the buildings loading dock and garage.) You have multiple police officers on detail there, yet little is done to enforce existing rules, much less impose some common sense on the haphazard decisions of so many drivers that create additional bottlenecks. This morning I saw a detail officer snugly tucked into his car parked in a line of commercial vehicles while just over his right shoulder a minivan had double parked in the open only travel lane. Traffic had backed up around multiple corners and intersections, creating congestion as far back as the surface artery. Some simple hands on management and aggressive safety measures and restrictions that favor pedestrians over vehicles would go a long way down there.
