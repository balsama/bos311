The gas main is over 100 years old, and obviously needs replacement. The City highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs. The City acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However in the long run the construction is well worth it. Having a street dug up for emergency repairs soon after paving is frustrating for all. With the new gas main installed, the city can feel extremely comfortable that no embarrassing street cuts will happen if it determines to pave your street in the future. After N.Grid posted ther street it came to our attention from local residents that a pre construction meeting should be held first. Which they did last Wednesday. The job will be done in phases to try to allow as much parking as possible while the work takes place. You can call Steve Fox at  617-633-1226 for more details.
