Other | Details: I was going on Providence street searching for a parking space and as I had just entered, I saw a truck coming the wrong way. There was a white car who had to back-off just to let this truck in which was coming from the wrong direction. Providence st. is a narrow one way st with parking on both the sides. I reached half way where there were empty spots and pulled in one of them and there was a person standing there who started yelling at me saying that I need to back off as there truck was coming in (wrong way). I asked him the reason and he said that he had the permit for the parking while the case was that on Sunday's, it is not reserved for commercial vehicles. I also could not see any special parking permit hanging anywhere. They had blocked both the sides of the road (equivalent to almost 6-8car parking spaces) with wooden crates and orange cones. I asked him why I couldn't park and he started shouting that I need to back off as their truck was coming and on asking him again, he threatened me saying that my car could be damaged as their truck was pulling right in. I have the truck number and the person's image along with number plate of the truck. Please take the required action against this people who put people's life in danger, threaten them as well as break the laws.
