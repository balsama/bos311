{"service_request_id":"101002231910","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector spoke to the contractor and reminded him that he needs to strictly follow the city's dust control protocols when excavating in the city. You should see an immediate improvement. The CIU inspector will regularly monitor this location to ensure full compliance. National Grid is replacing a gas main that is almost 100 years old.  The city encourages this type of capital upgrade work.  It will provide dependable gas service to the residents as well as eliminate future emergency repairs. The City acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However in the long run the placement of a new gas main is well worth it. National Grid has to install the gas main first.  Once the main has been installed, then all service connections can be made. If the City were to make National Grid pave to grade each day's trench work,  it would cause multiple seams along the trench. More importantly, every service connection needs to be cut into the trench.  If we were to pave the trench every day,  this would result in 2 by 2 patches inside the trench area, ending up with a very poor final paved product. In order to have the best final paving, the City allows the utility company to leave the trench down low until all service connections are made and then pave the trench all at once, resulting in a smooth, level final trench repair. Service laterals are topped within 24 hours of excavation. What the constituent is observing is the trench left down low in preparation for one continuous final paving operation. We do require that the contractor place florescent orange signs ahead of the construction informing motorists that the trench ahead is down low.

The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) investigated and determined the following:. National Grid is replacing a gas main that is over 100 years old. In addition to replacing a 100 year old main National Grid is replacing every gas service to each resident/business. The City highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs.   Especially if we plan on paving the street in the future. The City acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However replacing mains over 100 years old ensures solid dependable gas service for another 100 years. In speaking with the National Grid Supervisor he states  the paving crew showed up late that night to top the trench.. Feeney Brothers has spoken with the crew and this will not happen again. The good news is that National Grid states this work will be completed this week. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

{"service_request_id":"101002210275","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. When the City paves or reconstructed a street it wants a 5 year moratorium on any excavation work. We call these streets guaranteed streets. In order to have  the most efficient coordination for streets not to be dug up after paving has taken place the Boston Public Works Construction Management Division (CMD) created an online reservation system for all utility and road and sidewalk work. The reservation system is called the City of Boston Utility Coordination Software (COBUCS). No one can get a permit without entering the job into the COBUCS system. Since COBUCS has been developed in 2010 there have been over 10,000 conflicts identified where paving was held up until the work was done. . If COBUCS didn?t flag those conflicts it would have cost utility companies, private homeowners/business, rate payers, and City Departments over $35 Million Dollars in paving restoration fees on guaranteed streets. We still may end up with guaranteed street cuts due to emergency work or development after the coordination process and paving is completed. We consider COBUCS a rousing success and Boston is glad that we have the system. When it comes to Peter Parley and the other streets in Jamaica Plain, we coordinated with Verizon to make sure that any work for the Fios system that needed to be done, was done before paving took place.

{"service_request_id":"101002230951","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) investigated and determined the following:. National Grid is replacing a gas main that is over 100 years old. In addition to replacing a 100 year old main National Grid is replacing every gas service to each resident/business. The City highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs.   Especially if we plan on paving the street in the future. The City acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However replacing mains over 100 years old ensures solid dependable gas service for another 100 years. National Grid is required to send letters to each of the residents before the construction starts informing them of the job and contact information. The National Grid Public Relations Rep Peter Nagle can be contacted at 617-293-1490 regarding your claim that you were not notified. Peter can also give you a good esitmated time of completion on when the new gas main will be completed. .  The CIU Inspector for your neighborhood is Mal Flynn.  Mall can be rached at 781-983-4201. You can call Mal anytime regarding issues on the street that need immediate attention. Again the City apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.

{"service_request_id":"101002228513","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) investigated and determined the following:. National Grid is replacing the  gas main on Downer Ave  that is over 100 years old. In addition to replacing a 100 year old main National Grid is replacing every gas service to each resident/business. The City highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs.   Especially if we plan on paving the street in the future. The City acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However replacing mains over 100 years old ensures solid dependable gas service for another 100 years. National Grid is required to send letters to each of the residents before the construction starts informing them of the job and contact information. The National Grid Public Relations Rep Peter Nagle can be contacted at 617-293-1490.  The CIU Inspector for your neighborhood is Mal Flynn at 781-983-4201.
