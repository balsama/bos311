The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector investigated and determined the following:. Verizon Fios posted your street. We have told permittees when they post a street in Boston they must show up for the dates indicated on the sign. Parking is a premium and we acknowledge that is is frustrating moving your car and not having anyone show up. We understand that sometimes construction has unforeseen issues like equipment breakdowns, asphalt plants not available etc. resulting in not working the days posted. However we have told the permittees they must change the dates on the signs to reflect the new work dates. We have instructed Verizon to pull down the signs and repost 48 hours before they want to perform the work, and to make sure they work the days posted. We apologize for the inconvenience you incurred. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) investigated and determined the following:. Eversource Electric had an oil leak on its transmission line. This transmission line is critical for the power supply to South Boston. Eversource has been working ever since to rectify this critical situation. This was not planned work. They totally understand and regret the tremendous impact they are having on the residents near this work. That is why Eversource sent out flyers to the neighborhood explaining the situation. They have had to place stationary work zones along the route of the repair which included H St, K St, and now East Second. This is to protect the workers and the public. They have police details and Eversource Supervisors who are allowing residents access in and out. Public Works and the Transportation Department also understand the inconvenience to the South Boston residents for this necessary work and we also apologize. There is a 24 hour project hotline number 617-541-7634 if you needed something addressed right away.If you want to reach out to Eversource to discuss this matter further you can email John Hoey at John.Hoey@eversource.com.
