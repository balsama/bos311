My lease says I am responsible for snow removal but I believe that is an invalid clause in multi unit rental properties. My landlord is threatening myself and the other tenants with any fines if we get reported for not shoveling the sidewalk in front of our building (we do try our best to shovel but apparently one of our neighbors emailed the landlord about it). Is my landlord technically responsible for shoveling as it is a multi unit rental property?
