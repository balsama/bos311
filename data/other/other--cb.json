Stop signs installed for speed control in the past have been found to be counterproductive, and have increased mid-block speeds between stop signs and reduced compliance at stop signs. BTD is currently in the process of implementing the Neighborhood Slow Streets program for traffic calming in two pilot areas. We are developing an application process so other neighborhoods can benefit from traffic calming and reduced speeds on their streets. You can learn more about the program at visionzeroboston.org/nss.
