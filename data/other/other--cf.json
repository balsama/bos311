{"service_request_id":"101001940961","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Resolved. The Boston Parks and Recreation Department apologizes for any confusion regarding the trees and the current capital improvement project. The project at Medal of Honor Park includes planting over fifty new trees which will bring diversity to vegetation of the park making a significant generational investment to the long term success of the park's tree canopy. The trees to be planted comprise a varied population of species that are suitable for Medal of Honor Park in terms of scale and environmental benefit resulting in more shaded park locations, bird habitat and diminished wind impact. New plantings will be located where the twelve trees were removed within the past week and additional trees will be planted along the park perimeter, pathways and the play area as discussed at the fourth Community Meeting held on March 23, 2016. Species will include red maples (14), horse chestnuts (3), honey locusts (3), london plane trees (4), red and swamp white oaks (16), lindens (3), disease resistant American Elms (4) along with ornamental tree species of redbuds (4) and magnolias (4) known for their seasonal display. . All but one tree that was removed were deemed in poor health and/or showing signs of decline posing a safety risk especially during high wind storm events. The one tree (in fair condition) was removed to improve access within the new playground limits. As part of the design process, evaluation of the park trees were provided by the City's Tree Division including the City Tree Warden and additional staff of trained Certified Arborists. Based on the provided evaluation and recommendations made on March 11, 2016, tree removals were identified and the breadth and location of specific removals were discussed at the fourth community meeting. Additional recommendations by the City's Tree Division included pre-treating for environmental stress brought about by construction, the Sugar Maples through the use of soil amendments. This work was donated and completed as part of a day of service by a certified arborist on Arbor Day 2016. . The Parks and Recreation Department has a commitment to the improvement and long term health the City's tree canopy. The new trees should provide a healthier, more resilient canopy which will promote an ecologically diverse green space within South Boston. If you have any questions, please contact Project Manageer Michele Folts at 617-961-3025. Thank you.","service_name":"Other","service_code":"4f38920fe75084437f0001a0","description":"UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!

As I sit here, mopeds are flying up and down the one way roads - often in the wrong direction. This has been a daily occurrence all summer and into the fall. Since posting about this issue in May 2015, I have seen two efforts to solve the problem: \r\n1. On one afternoon, I saw a cop patrolling the intersection to ticket those who did not stop at the stop sign. Only ONCE in a year and a half have I seen someone enforcing the stop signs. As a stay-at-home mom, we are outside nearly every day, rain or snow or shine, so it is unlikely that  it has been patrolled more often and I just missed it.\r\n2. A sign was hung that reads \"Drive Slow\" and has a picture of a running child. That's a nice gesture. However, the signs have been entirely ineffective considering the excessive speeding that still occurs at this intersection.\r\n\r\nI ask you respectfully to please again consider my request for speed humps which will actually slow the traffic and lead to a safer road for my children and my neighbors' children. Please let me know the procedure on how to obtain these. Do I need a signed petition by neighbors? If so, I know this can happen.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\nSincerely,\r\na concerned mother and neighbor \nThe user entered the address: 68 Monadnock St, Boston, Massachusetts to see more details visit: http://seeclickfix.com/issues/3017136","requested_datetime":"2016-10-21T14:04:16-04:00","updated_datetime":"2016-10-28T09:13:23-04:00","address":"68 Monadnock St, Boston, Massachusetts","lat":42.3147765,"long":-71.0692917},
