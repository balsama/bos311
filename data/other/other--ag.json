The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector investigated and determined the following:. . The contractor is installing a mandatory firepipe service connection. . Hopefully the work will be done by Monday. When a utility or contractor is working in Boston and the work is on the sidewalk they have two options regarding pedestrian notification. . They can create a temporary path of travel around the work zone, which means they will have to send pedestrians into the roadway, barricaded off, and two temporary asphalt ramps from the edgestone. . The other option which is mostly used, is to place sidewalk closed signs at the nearest crosswalks on either side of the construction. The signs tell the pedestrians to cross to the other side avoiding walking into the street. . Because of Boston's narrow streets and its limited parking it is very difficult to have temporary paths of travel.   The usual notification for pedestrians is to have sidewalk closed signs placed. . The Inspector will go out to the job today to make sure all the appropriate sidewalk closed signs are placed. . For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. . Sincerely,. .
