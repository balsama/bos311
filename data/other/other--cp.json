It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes. The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride. What you observed was the patch down in binder awaiting the final top course. The patches are scheduled to be topped within a week.  Any questions you call the City Engineer Tom Mougamian. 617-304-7308.  I hope the explanation clarified your concerns. The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.

Literally from 2:30pm until 8pm and from 8am until 11or more cars are backed up on South St from the monument down to Forest Hills. We as a neighborhood association will be having the city monitor the pollution levels. But wouldn't an easy solution be to have signs up with alternative routes. If it's spelled out and the sign specifically says there will be stand still traffic all the way down the street maybe then people would seek another way to go. There are three other ways. I thought the definition of a crazy person is when they do the same thing more then three times. These people idle their car in stand still traffic every day!
