{"service_request_id":"101002023801","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent. National Grid is installing a new main on your street. The city highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs. The city acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However in the long run the construction is well worth it. Having a street dug up for emergency repairs soon after paving is frustrating for all. With the new gas main installed, the city can feel extremely comfortable that no embarrassing street cuts will happen if it determines to pave your street in the future. Even though the contractor will be installing a new main usually for hundreds of feet and in some cases the entire street, we have told the contractor to only post where he will be for the next few days. This will allow more parking on the street. . Feeney Brothers has been on Sumner St for 2 weeks.  They posted the street 48hrs before they started the work. . We have told the contractor that when you are posting please try to keep the dates of work as accurate as possible and not list the entire dates of work listed on the permit. When people see the entire date of the permit they get the impression they will not be able to park there for the duration of the job.  Which in some cases is up to 90 days,  when in reality the work in front of your house may only be for a couple days.  This is why the contractor changes the dates periodically. Based on your case notes I am providing the contract info for the National Grid personnel to contest the ticket. Peter Nagle 617-293-1490.

The public works department needs to do a better job addressing the space savers. Especially the public works in Roslindale. I've made multiple requests in the last 10 days about space savers on Claxton st, Brookway Rd, and Archdale Rd and Public works never did anything about it!!! They closed all of my cases, they said \"removed\" and didn't bother to take a picture. I drove by the area 10 minutes later and the same space savers were still there!! I wouldn't even be surprised if they didn't even bother driving by!!! I'm so upset about this!! I reposted on 311 after that happened and nobody even bothered to reply!! I'm assuming that they probably dont view it as a big deal or perhaps the public works employees use space savers themselves so they don't want to remove them. My fear is that the neighbors are gonna assume that they can get away with this since the city isn't doing anything about it.
