This truck has to hold up traffic for quite awhile so a lot of cars line up behind it. There is always one spot where the truck has the opportunity to pull over and let everyone go. Today, the truck had more than one opportunity to let cars go and instead stopped inconveniently so no one could pass. Finally when the usual spot to pull over came up, the driver still chose not to. They stopped where I could just barely get my car through and when asked to either help guide me or move the truck literally 6 inches the man outside of the truck chose to simply yell at me. This is wildly unacceptable behavior. The man behind me was having a mental breakdown while these workers couldn't be bothered to move their truck 3 feet. I respect the jobs that need to get done and the people who do them, but this is ridiculous.","requested_datetime":"2017-05-23T18:29:02-04:00","updated_datetime":"2017-05-24T09:33:08-04:00","address":"Intersection Of Chestnut Hill Dr & Commonwealth Ave, Brighton","lat":42.33643666666666,"long":-71.1556695,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/5924b7a30485a119f296bb48/report.jpg"},

{"service_request_id":"101002087514","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. Before excavating in Massachusetts, its the law to call dig safe so that out all the underground utilities are marked out with paint. This allows the contractor to dig safely and not to hit an underground utility line such as the gas main. Its is rightfully so a mandatory requirement . The City does shares your frustration that after the work is complete the paint could be being viewed as graffiti by the public. We have reached out to the utility companies asking if they could develop a paint that wore off more quickly. Obviously the paint needs to stay visible while the work takes place. Because there is so much excavation going on in the City, if we require a utility to power wash off a digsafe marking, we may be washing off new dig safe markings for another ticket called in for a  new excavation. This could cause a contractor to inadvertently hit an underground pipe causing a possible Public Safety situation  and creating a liability issue for the City. Its a dilemma that we are working on, its not an easy remedy .. However it's important to remember that Public Safety trumps all. Eventually the paint should wear off over time. If the markings are still there in the next 60 -90 days please contact my office. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.
