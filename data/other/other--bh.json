{"service_request_id":"101002268307","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Noted. From the first complaint, these were the actions taken by the Environment Department:. . I checked the area on Thursday 11/9/17 and there was some excavation work going on at the corner of Warren Street & Clifford Street.\u00a0 They are installing a conduit for signal foundation, new ramps and\u00a0signal hardware for new signal upgrade.\u00a0 When I spoke to the contractor from Vigil Electric Company, he mentioned that they only work from 9am - 3:30 pm.\u00a0 I checked that information with BTD and they confirmed it.\u00a0. . I then followed-up with the complainant twice to get more information about where the noise was coming from. He informed me that he has not heard the noise anymore for the past five days.\u00a0\u00a0. . I then returned yesterday(11/20/17) to check the area again, I made the contour of the building(s) that the complainant mentioned, I did not hear anything running or making noise.\u00a0 Most of the businesses on that block were closed except for one, the dry cleaner.\u00a0 I went in and asked the guy in charge there, and he said he has nothing running there. I did not see any equipment in the back either (at ground level).\u00a0 I immediately contacted the complainant while I was there to get more information from him.\u00a0 He couldn't give me any and he asked to check with his wife which I did.\u00a0 She said the same thing, they don't know what it is but it was noisy on Saturday and that noise woke them up. . I then found out who the owner of the building is and contacted her today.\u00a0 She reported that the building(s) do not have any equipment that make any noise. I asked her to check one the HVAC equipment that I saw on the side of one of the buildings. She said no one ever complained about anything except for these people. She said there is a laundromat but it closes early, but will check with the laundry owner or dry cleaner to see if anything was left running.\u00a0 So, I plan to meet with the building owner some time next week, to see what else could cause these complaints.\u00a0. . The complainant(s) don't know where the noise is coming from, so it is hard for me to figure it out as well, if they cannot provide more information.\u00a0 Thank you! .

{"service_request_id":"101002268925","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. You are correct The Boston Public Works Department institutes a moratorium on digging between November 15 and April 1st because the weather conditions can affect the quality of the repairs. However, the City realizes that some construction has to take place during the moratorium period. We have a moratorium board that meets twice a week and reviews hardship applications requesting excavation to take place. For example a new laundry mat is scheduled to be opened in January,  however it can't open up without a gas service. If the gas service isn't installed the property owners may not be able to make their mortgage payments. There is also work that needs to take place before they City paves the street next year. There are many other examples where utility work needs to take place or there will be a financial hardship for the owners. For your particular inquiry, the contractor is installing a new sewer line for the building at 799 River St. The Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector will make sure the contractor is following our rules at all times. I hope this explanation helps your understanding of why the work is taking place. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

Commercial street also has a few that go unused as well, specifically on the side closest to Charlestown where half the street isn't occupied by residents and the buildings on the other side, don't have elevators. \nOften when you do see these spots filled it will be with a car that is from out of town, like in the picture I included.

{"service_request_id":"101002265601","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Noted. Thank you for bringing your concern to our attention. Please know that federal criteria in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) prevents cities and towns from installing stop signs for speed control (Section 2B.04). Stop signs installed for speed control in the past have been found to be counterproductive, and have increased mid-block speeds between stop signs and reduced compliance at stop signs. Where Palmer St and Warren intersect is not a pedestrian way, it's where Warren Street merges together to form bidrectional adjacent lanes.  This has been taken into consideration where the appropriate pedestrian crosswalk would be located 150 away at Ruggles and Warren. BTD is currently in the process of implementing the Neighborhood Slow Streets program for traffic calming in two pilot areas. We are developing an application process so other neighborhoods can benefit from traffic calming and reduced speeds on their streets. You can learn more about the program at visionzeroboston.org/nss. We suggest that you also add any additional concerns to our safety issues map at the following link: app01.cityofboston.gov/VZSafety/.

The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) know one of its most important responsibilities is to make sure utilities and private contractors are following our no parking procedures. For example:  some jobs will require installing a new main usually for hundreds of feet and in some cases the entire street, we have told the utility companies and private contractors to only post where they will be for the next week or so. This will allow more parking on the street. Thats always been the City's goal to provide as much marking as possible during construction. We have provided them labels to change the dates as they move down the street. In this particular case we will talk to Verizon and make sure that this sign with previously posted and had the dates changed to reflect the new work dates. If this wasn't the case, we will have them take the signs down and repost. We apologize for the inconvenience you incurred. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below.
