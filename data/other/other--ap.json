There are many new young people who have moved to this street and they are driving up Jenkins towards Dorchester Street and I am giving them the benefit of the doubt that they don't know it is a one Way street as there is no signage indicating that it is one way.  There are young children attending cap at the church that go up Jenkins and elderly neighbors.  Because the sidewalk are so narrow and the street is supposed to be a one way - a lot of folks walk down the street.\nI am requesting that one way street signs be posted before someone gets hit\nThanks!","requested_datetime":"2018-08-03T12:01:42-04:00","updated_datetime":"2019-09-10T12:00:43-04:00","address":"9 Jenkins St, 1, South Boston","lat":42.33082072211372,"long":-71.05370158954534},

{"service_request_id":"101002590294","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. . Before excavating in Massachusetts, it?s the law to call dig safe so that out all the underground utilities are marked out with paint. . This allows the contractor to dig safely and not to hit an underground utility line such as the gas main. . It is rightfully so a mandatory requirement. . The City does shares your frustration that after the work is complete the paint could be being viewed as graffiti by the public. . We have reached out to the utility companies asking if they could develop a paint that wore off more quickly. . Obviously the paint needs to stay visible while the work takes place. . Because there is so much excavation going on in the City, if we require a utility to power wash off a dig safe marking, we may be washing off new dig safe markings for another ticket called in for a new excavation. . This could cause a contractor to inadvertently hit an underground pipe causing a possible Public Safety situation and creating a liability issue for the City. . It?s a dilemma that we are working on; it?s not an easy remedy .. However it's important to remember that Public Safety trumps all. . Eventually the paint should wear off over time. . If the markings are still there in the next 60 -90 days please contact my office. . Sincerely,. . Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.
