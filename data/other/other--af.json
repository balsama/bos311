The City highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs. . The city acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. . However in the long run the construction is well worth it. . Even though the contractor will be installing a new main usually for hundreds of feet and in some cases the entire street, we have told the contractor to only post where he will be for the next few days. This will allow more parking on the street. That is why you sometimes see the date changes on the signs. We have told the contractor to make sure that the signs are accurate. Please don't hesitate to use the police officer on detail or the contractor to make sure that you have access in and out. We believe the work will be done either this week or next. You can email the Eversource supervisor at carol.boyan@eversource.com.
