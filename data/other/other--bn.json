{"service_request_id":"101002179269","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The City of Boston acknowledges that there has been a tremendous uptick in utility work and road improvement projects the last few years. We have old infrastructure that needs to be replaced. The explosion in development requires utility service connections as well. Obviously we need to maintain our roads and sidewalks, which we do yearly. Public Works created an online reservation system called City of Boston Utility Coordination Software (COBUCS)  Nobody in the City can do work including City Departments without first entering their proposed work into COBUCS. COBUCS flags conflicts telling us to hold off before paving. . Unfortunately  emergency work and service request work may come after the coordination of the paving took place. For the most part we have greatly eliminated streets being dug up after we have paved the street. It's a breakthrough, and we are proud of that. As far as the work itself, after it has been entered into COBUCS, the Boston Transportation Department is responsible for when and where and at what time work can take place. I don't work for the Transportation Department, but I know they have a system in place that tracks active work., which allows them to either stagger permit requests, or have them hold off etc... I recommend that you create another case specifically asking for the Transportation Department to get back to you on active permits issued. Our Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU)  does create a report published on our website Monday through Friday of all active work within the City. . https://www.boston.gov/departments/public-works. Hopefully the link can be useful. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

{"service_request_id":"101002191685","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. National Grid is installing a new gas main.  The city encourages this type of capital upgrade work.  It will provide dependable gas service to the residents as well as  eliminate future emergency repairs. The city acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However in the long run the placement of a new gas main is well worth it.  National Grid has to install the gas main first.  Once the main has been installed, then all service connections can be made. If the city were to make National Grid pave to grade each day's trench work,  it would cause multiple seams along the trench. More importantly, every service connection needs to be cut into the trench.  If we were to pave the trench every day,  this would result in 2 by 2 patches inside the trench area, resulting in a very poor final product. In order to have the best final paving, the city allows the utility company to leave the trench down low until all service connections are made and then pave the trench all at once, resulting in a smooth, level final trench repair. Service laterals are topped within 24 hours of excavation. What the constituent is observing is the trench left down low in preparation for one continuous final paving operation. We do require that the contractor place florescent orange signs ahead of the construction informing motorists that the trench ahead is down low. The work is expected to be completed within 2 weeks. If you have any questions you can call the Inspector Rob DiMare at 781-589-2587. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

My plot, E9, had many tools stolen from my tool box. The gate was still secured so someone must have jumped over the fence. The following was stolen: (2) hammers, wire cutters, pruning shears, kitchen scissors, box of assorted screws and nails, small hand saw, other trimming hand held shears, gloves, and a screw driver. There was no damage done to the plants or table/chairs. Several gardens in the surrounding plots were also affected by the break in.","requested_datetime":"2017-08-16T22:16:29-04:00","updated_datetime":"2017-08-16T22:16:00-04:00","address":"20 Park Dr, Boston","lat":42.3456571455654,"long":-71.09291449100434},
