We apologize for your inconvenience due to the temporary closure of one of the two outbound lanes into Charlestown on the North Washington Street Bridge. Due to recently identified structural safety concerns, the BPWD had started an emergency repair effort on the Bridge.  The required repair is very extensive and therefore also prompted the temporary closure of the outside lane to cordon off the area with many problematic members.  Unseen from the surface, these steel repairs has been performed below the bridge deck since the 3rd weekend in November, and is projected to go on at least to the end of February to mid-March 2018.  During the winter, it is very challenging and time consuming to perform these repairs. The construction project to replace this bridge has been advertised and the bids are to be opened in January 2018.

We are BPS parents who live in Jamaica Plain, with our child Hazel Lewy, who attends the BTU Pilot School in the 4th Grade. She's been a student there since K1, and we would hate to leave the amazing community of families, administrators and teachers we've connected with over the years.\nThe new 9:30 a.m. start and 4:00 p.m. end time at my school will not work for our family. Aside from the fact that a 9:30 start leaves us with nothing to do with our daughter in the morning between the hours of 7:30-9:30 a.m. (current bus pickup time) as both parents in our household work, we have developed a rich after school enrichment program schedule that balances out our child's life. \nShe takes theater classes that start at 3:34 with children from all over the area. This cannot be replaced by any on-site programming. Neither of us are able, or willing to remove her early from school classes  early to make it to her theater classes (nor would I hope BPS would want us to) in time to make it for their start. She attends Karate at 4:15 - while this is after 4pm,  there is no way her school bus would be able to get her from school to the site in time. She also attends Kids Arts in Jamaica Plain, which offers a robust variety of activities, such as music, dance, fine arts, cooking, outdoor time, theater and much more. \nBusing can often take 45 minutes or more from the BTU school to her site and 4pm is a heavy traffic period, especially in the area of the BTU school. She will not reach her destination site until 4:3-5pm which cuts out all of the homework time and most of the free play/outdoor time at Kids Arts and cuts into the enrichment activities that I mentioned above.\nA child's life is not just schooling. It should not be sitting on buses going from here to there. It should not be inadequate on-site school activities (which has been my experience with on-site care, which honestly is all it is) meant to pass the time in the morning because public school systems are trying to save money.\nThe BTU Pilot School currently starts at 8:30 am and I see no reason to change it's start time. It falls perfectly in line with research, scheduling and what BPS itself is saying it wants for schools. Why mess with a good thing? \nWe understand the intention of later start times for high school students, and the research you\u2019ve used, but not at the expense of our younger students.\nThe reality is BPS will be spending money, solving the problems that have been just created, to cover the cost of before and after care. \nIf schools need more money, let's fight to have private schools pay for their own buses, raise taxes so schools can afford what they need, fight the charters, look to other cities as models (grants such as Seattle, special city buses just for students, school buses that drop off students to more than one school). Stop messing around with our kid's scheduling, stop making up excuses and playing around with algorithms to make things appear scientific. Let's be real. These are kids and families. There are real people involved here. Number crunching isn't going to solve the problems of BPS. If BPS need cash, it needs to be generated. It may be hard but it's not harder than messing around with our families. \n\nWe strongly urge you to halt these proposed start and end times until you have gotten far more feedback on the impacts that such drastic changes will have on the children and families here. \nWe intend to continue working together with Boston Public School parents, administrators and teachers until our voices are heard. Families will not back down!\nThank you, \nThe Lewy Family\nErica, Michael and Hazel \n(age 9 who is so upset already about the possibility of missing out next year on her after school activities)\nBTU Pilot School Family","requested_datetime":"2017-12-21T12:30:32-05:00","updated_datetime":"2017-12-21T12:30:00-05:00","address":"40 1/2 Paul Gore St, 1, Jamaica Plain","lat":42.32052319831337,"long":-71.10894365628458},

{"service_request_id":"101002286992","status":"open","service_name":"Other","service_code":"4f38920fe75084437f0001a0","description":"This letter is in response to the announcement of the school start/end times announced by Tommy Chang this past week. I am writing to voice my concern as a parent to the extreme changes this WILL have to our family and undoubtedly for many families across the City of Boston. First, and most importantly, this change will have dramatic and negative impacts on our family unit. Our 4 year old son, who attends the Gardner Pilot Academy, will lose 1 hour and 15 minutes each morning and this will impact his sleep, nutrition, and ability to effectively and independently regulate himself prior to the start of the day. Due to the inappropriate start time recommended for his school, he will now have 35-minutes from the time he wakes to get himself ready and into his classroom (this includes the time it takes to commute to school). In this case, our family will lose 90-minutes each morning that allows us to function with minimal stress, eat breakfast at a table as a family, and communicate about the expectations of the day before transitioning to the car to begin the 12 minute commute to school. During our 90-minutes each morning, every second is spent supporting the development of vital Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) including, dressing, grooming, feeding, and transitioning. When that time is reduced, one parent WILL need to take the active role in rushing through dressing and grooming increasing stress and reducing our child\u2019s independence. In addition, nutrition will be SO NEGATIVELY impacted as breakfast would need to take place in the back of the car. That means, poor meal choices will occur sacrificing health and mealtime readiness that supports healthy and positive food choices. It is widely known that poor nutrition leads to increased illness, medical instability (changes to vitamin/mineral intake through food sources), rise in obesity, and negative relationships with food. BPS administration appears to be citing limited research supporting later start-times for middle/school and high school children. What they fail to acknowledge is that young child, who are often the most vulnerable in our city, also require 10-12 hours of sleep to develop successful academic readiness skills and positive experiences in the classroom. When the reduction in sleep occurs along with added stress from parents to rush out the door, poor nutrition choices due to convenience, increased financial stress, and longer school days for children who now need to stay in after-school care for a total of 10-11 hours, these children will show less ability to self-regulate both at school and home. This decision shows a lack of concern for ALL families who access education through BPS and a clear trend to appease families at preferred schools such as Boston Latin. It brings to light an underriding question of is this really an opportunity for the CIty to target the School Bus Drivers Union in order to close the budget gap? What will be the City\u2019s response when the MBTA is overburdened with the increase of riders during the 7:30-8:30am rush hour with High School students? How will that be fiscally managed?  The critical point to this drastic change is that the administration should see that NO FAMILY wants a school start time before 8:00am and the residents are clearly asking that the administration work to find a solution to support smart, healthy, positive changes to all school schedules. As a result of these changes our family will spend 5 hours less per week together and most likely need to work on managing negative behaviors in a 4 year old due to lack of sleep.\n\nAs a voting resident in Boston, this decision will have STRONG impact on ALL future city elections across all posts and positions going forward. It is vital that the City Council, the School Committee and the Mayor\u2019s office understand the immense effect this has on the future health and vitality of the city and its neighborhoods. Elected individuals and City Councilors who support this decision released by the Mayor, the school committee, and Tommy Chang will be looked at with increased skepticism and scrutiny. The decision and opinion given by each constituent will be tracked and taken into consideration for the next election cycle. People across the Allston-Brighton neighborhood including the GPA community have voiced their disgust with City Council and Mayor Walsh and his elected school committee. This is a city-wide crisis that needs attention and thoughtful consideration. The city is failing its children, teachers, schools, and families. I have never been so disappointed in Boston","requested_datetime":"2017-12-16T10:07:54-05:00","updated_datetime":"2017-12-16T10:07:00-05:00","address":"195 Kenrick St, Brighton","lat":42.34671913693003,"long":-71.17151552616666},

This change in School start and end times is ridiculous and not good for our city. You are making life impossible for working families that you say you would like to keep in the city. What you are doing, is asking people to leave. I find everything that has been said over the last week highly offensive. I was never asked to fill out a survey that BPS sent to other families. A survey only written in English. So how many other people did you exclude. Your administration claims this policy is to benefit high school students but the evidence is there, that this can harm young children. I am ashamed that I voted for you. You had no problem calling me everyday asking for my vote and I, like the rest of this city, trusted you. Well, I am going to contact you every day until you fix this mess and stop the times changes. And for the record, I grew up in this city and have fought to stay here.

With that said, we reviewed the intersection and have upgraded existing signs related to the pedestrian crossings on Saratoga St.","service_name":"Other","service_code":"4f38920fe75084437f0001a0","description":"We need stop sign is not active Park area there's no stop sign on the street","requested_datetime":"2017-09-24T09:28:23-04:00","updated_datetime":"2017-12-13T16:56:53-05:00","address":"785 Saratoga St, East Boston","lat":42.38402365245147,"long":-71.01638247265575,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/59c7b2e504856dbbdac7b864/report.jpg"},
