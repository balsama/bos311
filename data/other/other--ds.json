I'm a fairly cautious rider so was hanging back and thank goodness. I really thought it was turning left and I didn't see a signal. A police detail was right there so I told him I didn't see the truck signal and that it was a bit scary of a turn, and he was immediately defensive, saying the truck did signaI and walking away from me. I tried to explain that I did not see the light blinking, so maybe the cover is dirty or it's out, and he kept talking over me dismissively. I persisted and finally he said he'd go tell the driver to check his signal lights. I said thank you, that's all I was asking. I'm reporting this because it shouldn't have to be so hard and I shouldn't have been treated that way. It was honest concern for bicycle safety around a construction site and should be taken seriously.
