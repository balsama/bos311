The BPRD does not expect residents to water the trees but some residents do want to help and do water the trees. Watering a tree daily or even every other is detrimental to the trees health which is why it is not a practice that the department follows. The BPRD plants 1500 trees a year and the watering process that is being followed has been successful. There are some trees that no matter how much water the trees are given will still die. This can be from many factors from being the handling at the nursery, transportation of the tree from the nursery to the contractor and other unforeseen instances that happen before the tree is planted by the BPRD. The reason the trees are under warranty for two years and are replaced free of charge to the City are because of all these contributing factors. The tree in question will be inspected this summer as well as next summer.
