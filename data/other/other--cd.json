Most school zone signs have been changed to \"when children are present\" for this exact same issue. Boston Police can now enforce the limit at all times as long as there are children nearby. BTD is currently in the process of implementing the Neighborhood Slow Streets program for traffic calming in two pilot areas. We are developing an application process so that other neighborhoods, including yours, can benefit from traffic calming and reduced speeds. You can learn more about the program at visionzeroboston.org/nss.

A couple of years ago we had the city put in this traffic slowing sign at the school zone for 20 miles an hour. There have been several incidents recently of near misses with kids being hit by speeding cars up School st. This sign at night is not enough. It is not visible in dark with glare of street light above. The cross walk is not bright enough on the ground either. There is nothing to slow down people during Afterschool times that go up to 6 pm. A speed table/bump or flashing lights to indicate school zone until 6 pm. The current sign only says \"when children present.\" So people may not realize the school is active until around 6 pm. \nThanks for looking into this safety manner. \nKaren","requested_datetime":"2016-12-12T20:22:50-05:00","updated_datetime":"2016-12-14T16:47:37-05:00","address":"Intersection Of Erie Pl & School St, Jamaica Plain","lat":42.31407166666666,"long":-71.09873883333333,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/584f4d5d0485b8e8d344d9de/report.jpg"},
