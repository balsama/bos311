{"service_request_id":"101001543465","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving. It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes. The utility work previously done on your street was left with a temporary patch. The City of Boston does not want the permanent asphalt cross section (typically 6.5\" on residential street and 7.5\"on main arterials) to be put back after the gravel down to the pipe has been disturbed. There is a possibility that settlement could occur. Thats why the City waits before performing the cross section repair.  Our permanent patches hardly ever settle and that is the goal that any City or Town would want to happen regarding utility excavation work. We do have a unit that inspects backfilling and temporary patches (The Construction Inspection Unit CIU) The CIU does stay on top of the contractors and utility companies.  Many of the temporary patches are in good condition. However, the key is the patch is only 3\".  We need the full cross section put back. This is what you are seeing being done on your street right now. Below is the steps taken to do the permanent repair. The construction process is to dig out 6.5 to 7.5\" inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride. I hope this explanation clarifies things for you. If not please don't hesitate to call me. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

{"service_request_id":"101001541784","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving. It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes. The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of  the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt  that provides the smooth ride. The street is leafleted before the work begins where it explains that it is a mufti phase construction operation and you should look at the dates since they will change as each construction phases progresses. Our goal is to allow parking between phases and not post the street for the entire time the work takes place. This is why the contractor repeatedly changes the dates. We spoke to the contractor about his need to be totally accurate when posting and leafleting  for upcoming work. Since this is a patching contract, the contractor may only be on your street for only a short period of time; giving the appearance of not showing up. Sometimes  poor weather, plant breakdowns, or equipment failure occurs which results in the delay of the upcoming work. The CIU spoke to the contractor about his need to do a better job on changing the dates when those situations arise. As far as the permit is concerned, because the City is patching an entire neighborhood, we issue the contractor a neighborhood permit instead of individual permits for the many streets they will be working on. The BTD has the list of streets that the contractor is patch paving. This allows the work to be done in a timely manner. The permit number EXCA-347028 is for the neighborhoods of the South End/Back Bay. Any questions you call the City Engineer Tom Mougamian. 617-304-7308. The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.  Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

The Boston Public Works Department is responsible to maintain the streets and sidewalks of The City of Boston. There are various ways to accomplish that. Each street is surveyed and placed in a repair category. Most of you are familiar with the reconstruction and resurfacing categories. There are many streets that have not reached the resurfacing and reconstruction category. For these streets we will seal cracks to provide additional life to the street. This will allow us to hold of on resurfacing and use our funds for streets that really need it. It is a common preservation practive used not only in Massachusetts but the entire country. That's what was done on Bennington St. I apologize for not getting back to you earlier. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

The city acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However in the long run the construction is well worth it. Having a street dug up for emergency repairs soon after paving is frustrating for all. With the new gas main installed, the city can feel extremely comfortable that no embarrassing street cuts will happen if it determines to pave your street in the future. The trench has been left to grade in binder.  National Grid will come back and mill the trench place top with a roller. We have instructed the Contractor to put back the pavement markings within 3 days. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.
