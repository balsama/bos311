As I mentioned, the traffic on Church Street is very heavy and very fast especially during commuter hours on Church Street between West Roxbury Pkwy and Weld Street. There is a stop sign at Parklawn St but that does nothing to slow the vehicles in front of our house where they are accelerating. It is frustrating to have cars honk but not brake as you try to get off your driveway. I am asking for some traffic calming measures to lower the speed and perhaps discourage some of the cut through drivers. I believe the traffic issue on the DCR parkways contribute to the volume of cut through vehicles.

The school printed signs (looks like from a regular computer)and hung them up saying right turn only, when leaving the school. \nEvery afternoon the principal stands in the middle of river street, and stops traffic in both directions, on river street. One day there was an accident where a motor bike rear ended a car because the principal stopped traffic so abruptly. The school has a regular crossing guard. The principal blocks the cars coming out of the school and tells them they have to turn right, only. On Friday she told drivers the Boston police would give them a $75 ticket if they turned left. She pointed at the crossing guard. I asked the crossing guard if she gives tickets, and she said no. The principal is creating a traffic backup, both ways on river street, every time she stops traffic to let cars out of the school. Then we have to also stop 10 feet away because the crossing guard is crossing kids at the crosswalk. She does a good job with the kids.","requested_datetime":"2018-10-01T13:53:13-04:00","updated_datetime":"2018-10-01T13:53:00-04:00","address":"912 916 River St, Hyde Park","lat":42.26172196217092,"long":-71.11050143844551,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/5bb25ef6750539b9618f1633/report.jpg"},

I am asking that this report be forwarded to the school department in effort to derail an issue that is occurring within our property. Adjacent to the Charlestown development is the Charlestown High School where numerous times the students will be found smoking marijuana in our common area. This is of great concern with residents who are on oxygen, asthmatic children who can't breathe this type of smoke in. \n\nOn Friday September 28th we received numerous calls for students smoking in the common area. Upon notifying the students to leave they became combative and confrontational. The individual on the first photo became very aggressive and not once but twice threw an umbrella directed toward my head. This individual repeated this action by sticking a finger within inches of my face. At that point we contacted Boston Police to report to the address located at 161 Bunker Hill St. The other individual who\u2019s description proceeds as such : African American male skinny build dyed blue hair was a aggressive as well stating \u201cthis is the projects no one cares if we smoke\u201d I challenged this individual stating we have seniors and minors who can\u2019t breathe this type of smoke in\u201d The individuals began to scream racial remarks toward my direction all the while being disrespectful not only to myself but our residents. I am looking for you to identify these students so we may issue trespass notices to avoid them from coming onto our property. \nYour attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.","requested_datetime":"2018-09-28T15:43:57-04:00","updated_datetime":"2018-09-28T15:43:00-04:00","address":"161 Bunker Hill St, Apt 1108, Charlestown","lat":42.37859740000003,"long":-71.0607512},
