Most of the individual space markings currently in existence were done through development projects that didn't realize that the City of Boston does not mark individual spaces. We don't stripe individual spaces for a variety of reasons, but the main two are maintenance costs (we'd rather keep the money going to crosswalk striping and other safety programs) and that marked spaces reduce the number of overall parking spaces. It's easy to notice that a car might be parked in a way that makes another spot just shy of being long enough, but when we actually mark spaces, they need to be long enough to fit the longest of cars (Suburbans, trucks, etc).
