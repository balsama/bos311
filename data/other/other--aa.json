I\u2019m familiar with the rules and policies of this rental permit application, as they\u2019re listed on the City of Boston website and I\u2019ve been using the permit since October of last year. \nThe issues that I\u2019ve been having with the parking clerks office is because of the fact that they are making up rules/ policies as they go along, and not actually adhering to the policies listed on the City of Boston website, as it pertains to this particular permit. When I file complaints about the issues, they seem to not have any supervision and policing themselves when it comes to not following policies.\nThe most recent Rental Permit Application that I\u2019ve applied and been approved for was last Monday (3/11/2019-3/18/2019). I resubmitted the weekly application yesterday for the new week, and this morning I received an email stating that the rental application was denied. When I\u2019ve received emails of denial in the past, I\u2019ve had clerks state the following reasons for denying my application:\n- Rental contracts have to be on company letterhead from Hertz or Lyft (the companies I rent from)\n- Even though my rental contract through the Lyft express Drive Program auto-renews everyweek that I\u2019m active, I can\u2019t apply for rental permit for the length of 30 days. I have to re-apply for each individual week that my contract auto-renews.\n- And most recently, this morning, I was informed by a clerk and her supervisor that my application was denied because the parking clerks office no longer accepts rental applications from driver through the express drive program. Only Hertz, Enterprise, and other reputable rental companies. The clerk and her supervisor informed me that they\u2019ve been making \u201cexceptions\u201d for me by approving all of my previous applications dating back to October.\n\nMy issues are that since October, I\u2019ve been going back and forth between the clerks office and the companies I rent my work vehicles from (Lyft, Hertz), making sure I provide accurate rental contracts and vehicle info to the clerks offic. The information requested of me by the clerks office is in compliance with the actual policies LISTED on the City of Boston site, and whatever policies the clerks make up on their own. Only to now be told I\u2019ve only been receiving permits because the supervisor and clerks who report to her have been only making exceptions for me. \nThis is unethical and frustrating because I ha e nowhere else to park this work vehicle, and this puts me at risk for tow and citations if I park the car within my residential area. It\u2019s also unfair that the clerks office oversees and policies themselves, making up rules and exceptions as they go along.\n\nI\u2019d greatly appreciate if you were able to mediate or assist me in this matter, or point me in the direction of someone who can.","requested_datetime":"2019-03-19T11:02:17-04:00","updated_datetime":"2019-03-19T11:02:00-04:00","address":"1 City Hall Plz, Boston","lat":42.36032200000001,"long":-71.05796699999999},

BTD will install corner restriction signs on the corners of Greenwood St to improve visibility and sight distance. Also, please know that federal criteria in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) prevents cities and towns from installing stop signs for speed control (Section 2B.04). Stop signs installed for speed control have been found to be counterproductive, and have increased mid-block speeds between stop signs and reduced compliance at stop signs. BTD is currently in the process of implementing the Neighborhood Slow Streets program for traffic calming. We are developing an application process so that other neighborhoods can benefit from traffic calming.
