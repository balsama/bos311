This proved to be a very difficult repair, resulting in National Grid working into the night. We did find out from National Grid that after the first night of emergency work they did leave the work zone during the day. National Grid is required to do mandatory follow up testing of the leak repairs and they ended up finding another leak, and that is why they came back again. The work is now completed. I have asked Terry Cleary of National Grid to respond to you since obviously they are the experts regarding emergency gas repairs. Terry can be reached at teresa.cleary@nationalgrid.com. On behalf of the City we apologize that you had to put up with the gas leak repairs on off hours. If you want to discuss this matter further, please don't hesitate to contact the number listed below.

It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes.  The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt  that provides the smooth ride. The street is leafleted before the work begins where it explains that it is a mufti phase construction operation and you should look at the dates since they will change as each construction phases progresses.  Our goal is to allow parking between phases and not post the street for the entire time the work takes place. This is why the contractor repeatedly changes the dates.

I believe that the hospital should be forced to replace the sidewalk that was removed when the hospital was built. The addition of the new traffic light and the new traffic pattern on Walter St make walking on the hospital side of Walter St perilous since drivers round the corner too fast and have to swerve into the left only lane to avoid a walker. The current situation is a problem for both walkers and drivers.
