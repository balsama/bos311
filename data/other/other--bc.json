My apartment is currently at 63 degrees which is illegal according to MA heat laws but landlord claimed to other tenants that radiators were turning on and off but they have not been on for hours (building provides oil heat).","requested_datetime":"2018-01-15T08:06:51-05:00","updated_datetime":"2018-01-18T17:29:37-05:00","address":"378 380 Washington St, Brighton","lat":42.34907333743045,"long":-71.15421733825566},

Thank you for submitting your thoughts on the bike lane on Surface Rd, approximately at Essex Street (judging by the photo uploaded). While we understand that the length of the bike lane through the intersection is somewhat uncomfortable, the angle/radius of the lane is matched to the receiving side of the road. The white dashes on the left of the bike lane also serve as guidance lines for vehicles to stay away from. After the intersection, there is also a similarly sized bike lane. Often motorists flagrantly disregard this guidance and drift to the right to position themselves against the parked cars. This is not correct or acceptable. Double-parked vehicles are also a danger to cyclists trying to stay within the lane that is ascribed to them.  BTD will do its best after the winter season to repaint the lane and white dashed lines so that they are clearer, as well as trying to have a greater presence of Enforcement agents in this area to serve tickets to those vehicles stopped in the bike lane bear Beach Street, or in the bus stops nearer Kneeland Street.","service_name":"Other","service_code":"4f38920fe75084437f0001a0","description":"Purple bike lane doesn't match curve of the road.

{"service_request_id":"101002220674","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Noted. Thank you for submitting both your request for bike lanes and your observations of violations of traffic regulations. The parking protected bike infrastructure on Mass Ave in the Back Bay has been recently completed as part of the Vision Zero program in the City. While we understand that the facilities are in substandard condition, due to the recent snow/weather, BTD & PWD teams are working to identify and clear snow, debris, etc from all corridor spaces as quickly as possible.  In the early Spring, flexposts will be surveyed and replaced where needed. Regarding the violations of the traffic signal, BTD (even the Bikes & Planning folks) do not support or endorse the disregard for any traffic control device or regulatory sign by ANY roadway user. Safety is of the highest priority; and minimizing the unintended effects of mistakes made is a primary tenant of the Vision Zero program. Cyclists violating the red light of a traffic signal is the same as a motorist disregarding that a light has turned from yellow to red, and endangering users from other street approaches. If you continue to see such behavior exhibited by ANY roadway users, please submit a direct CRM with only that item to the BPD queue. Without the lane/infrastructure request, their constituent services agents can respond to you.","service_name":"Other","service_code":"4f38920fe75084437f0001a0","description":"Please paint bike lanes on Mass Ave from Boylston to Huntington.
