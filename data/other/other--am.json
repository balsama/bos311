It is very frustrating to get dressed for work and then be forced to stand in the rain because there are 3-4 homeless sleeping in the shelter designated for commuters.  They are normally there every morning until at least 9:30.  The attached photo was taken at 9:18.\nRequest 2:  There is a group of homeless on bikes who are stealing packages from building lobbies.  I have video of this which I sent to the police. These homeless bikers hang out at night by the veterans statue in the Fens park.  By day they bike around looking for small packages to steal.    \nThey also harass the residents.  On multiple times I have been called a white cxxx and my life was threatened.  I also have video of them in my lobby shooting up and trying to break into the building.  This video was also sent to police.\nRequest 3: yesterday one of the biker group was begging on the corner of Queensberry and Park.    Can beggars be stopped?\n\nIn summary,  I am afraid to walk in my own neighborhood.

I am all done with niceties.  \nPlease respond with someone, anyone who a) can tell me what's gonna be done about these issues without any bs whatsoever and, b) help me understand how I can help BPS be a more parent-friendly place.\nPlease.\n\nStart email:\n\nHello,\n\nI\u2019m writing to express concern regarding my child\u2019s morning bus driver.  My daughter is assigned to bus XXXXX, door to door service from our home to the XXXXXX School in Dorchester.  On both September 6 & 7 the bus was at least an hour & a half late, but that is not my main concern.  On September 6th, I witnessed the bus driver driving about 2 MPH in my neighborhood.  The driver would drive 5 ft, stop, drive 5 more feet, stop again, and so forth.  I suspect they weren\u2019t even stepping on the gas peddle.  It seemed as though they had never driven a vehicle in their life, never mind a school bus full of kids.  I spoke with the bus monitor and her explanation for the late arrival time was that the driver did not do a dry run of the route.  When I asked about why the driver was driving as though it was their very first day behind the wheel of ANY vehicle, the monitor shrugged.  The conversation between myself and the monitor was cut short because the driver pulled away when I asked why the driver wasn\u2019t able to take a simple left hand turn and was only driving 2 MPH at a stop & go pace.  \n\nI\u2019m told that the buses have devices on board that record the buses\u2019 motions.  I would like to know what the recordings  on my daughter\u2019s bus revealed and what is being done about it.  \n\nI would like a response to my concerns ASAP.  I cannot put my child on a bus with a driver who, very obviously, cannot drive.  Furthermore, the driver should not be driving a school bus until they are fully trained and confident that they can safely operate a bus full of children.  \n\nI look forward to hearing from someone as soon as possible.\n\nThank you,\nApril Terrio\n\nSent from my iPhone.\nApologies for typos and brevity.","requested_datetime":"2018-09-07T16:32:16-04:00","updated_datetime":"2018-09-07T16:32:00-04:00","address":"1 Worrell St, Dorchester","lat":42.29422140000003,"long":-71.049205},

Not that he doesnt slack like Ramon, they all do. Its what Curtis Hall staff allowed to do, what they want with no regards to management. Its what Torres allows. And again BCYF allowed for Torres to have his nephew working there. Of course he is bragging how he gets his way and fot his nephew whom he lies about who he is but yes BCYF head staff clearly know they are family. Again, another latino. It was not a opportunity given to anyone else. Both his supervisors are latino women, one that has been there for years and does less than a regular staff.  It is evident Torres is covering for her because there is no way she would hold a job if she was black. Thats why they sent the other latina supervisor so she could do the work for the first one. Its clear how the new one is the one you see working while the older one hides in her cave. Unbelavable what we members know about the issues at Curtis Hall.
