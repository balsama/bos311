{"service_request_id":"101002260215","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The City of Boston Public Works Department is responsible for clearing streets for paving.  In 2010 the Public Works Department created an online reservation software called The City of Boston Coordination Software (COBUCS). Before receiving a permit, every utility company, private contractor, City Departments, and Public Works paving projects all have to enter their work into the COBUCS system. The COBUCS system will alert the City and permittees of potential conflicts  This will allow coordination to take place that wasn't done as successful  before COBUCS. Since 2010 COBUCS has alerted the City of over 10,000 conflicts at a savings of over $40 million dollars of unnecessary paving fees if the street was cut after it was completed. No street will be paved unless officially cleared through the COBUCS system. Unfortunately COBUCS can't coordinate emergency work. Comcast had an outage Sunday night where 282 customers lost their service including 911. 18 of those customers were buildings that had fire alarm systems. That is why there were digging out there Sunday night. The cut is currently down in a binder course, and will be topped within the next few days. Next year the City will come back and pave 25 feet on either side of the cut. Comcast will pay for the paving. I hope this detailed explanation helps clarify your rightful frustration of a newly paved street being dug up. Any questions or concerns you can contact the number listed below. Sincerely,.

First off, there is A LOT more than just a deck going on. As you can see in the picture, there is currently a toilet out front. Last weekend, it was a hot water heater. Second, it doesn't seem legal that such loud construction work is allowed to happen for so many consecutive weekend days (because of the quality of life impact for neighboring properties). In the window, there is also an \"after-hours\" form for yesterday, which doesn't make sense considering they are about to be working under lights here on Sunday.
