I support their need for security but this fence has three major problems which ISD enforcement should address to remove the fence until an alternative can be reached:\n\n1) the fence is higher than 6 ft in this area. I'm not sure if the fence has been permitted, but there was not a ZBA hearing to seek relief for a fence of this height\n\n2) Mishawum's land disposition agreement (LDA) with the BRA requires design review approval before improvements like fences are installed.  They have not received this approval. \n\n3) most importantly, a fence at this location discourages public transit use in Charlestown. I'm sure an alternative arrangement for fencing and sidewalk access can be reached that will protect Mishawums parking while allowing pedestrians to pass through this area without having to walk done the dangerous part of Rutherford Ave","requested_datetime":"2018-10-24T18:39:27-04:00","updated_datetime":"2018-10-30T17:05:48-04:00","address":"50a Dunstable St, Charlestown","lat":42.37666836121485,"long":-71.06864742994237,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/5bd0f4947505f13b90127127/report.jpg"},
