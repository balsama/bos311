{"service_request_id":"101001129587","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Resolved. The Boston Public Works takes very seriously the responsibility of coordinating proposed paving projects with proposed utility street cut work. . The City has identified 22 utility companies and other City departments who regularly perform street cut work. . No street is paved unless all 22 entities clear the street. In 2009 the Boston PWD created an online reservation system called the City Of Boston Utility Coordination Software (COBUCS). . No utility company, private contractor, site plan engineer, or City department can receive a permit without first entering the work into COBUCS. . COBUCS will inform whether the entry is in conflict with another entry. Since 2009 over 3000 times, COBUCS has alerted the City and Permittees of a potential conflict. The City either held off the paving, or coordinated the work to get done before paving took place. . That is 3000 less cuts on guaranteed streets. . What we can't coordinate is emergency repairs. That is exactly what happened on Bateswell St. National Grid activated an emergency permit for a grade 1 leak. . It is incredibly frustrating for this to happen. The City does charge the offending utility extra paving fees to compensate for the cost of cutting into a brand new street. . That work will probably take place later this year, or next year. The City does not want to do any permanent repairs of any recent street cut work until a minimum of 90 days or preferable the next construction season. . The City will monitor the temporary patch left behind by National Grid. For any questions please don't hesitate to contact me at the number provided below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.
