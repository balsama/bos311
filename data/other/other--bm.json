We ask because every day, a fair number of cars drive down Park Lane, only to turn around and return up the hill.  Many times the drivers seem annoyed, based on how fast they speed back up the hill.  Clearer signage indicating that there's no exit from Park Lane, or otherwise clarifying this, might improve the driving experience for all who turn onto Park Lane by mistake, and for those of us who live and park on the street, it would reduce unnecessary traffic.  There are seniors and several families with young children who live on Park Lane, which raises the stakes when impatient drivers realize their mistake, turn around rapidly and zip back up the hill at high speed.\n\nThe City's neighborhood liaison recommended raising our question via this app.  Thank you!","requested_datetime":"2017-09-10T12:34:05-04:00","updated_datetime":"2017-09-14T07:10:24-04:00","address":"Intersection Of Park Ln & Walnut Ave, Jamaica Plain","lat":42.31046850200446,"long":-71.09791022173411},

It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes. The construction process is to first saw cut the areas identified needing repair. Then an excaation crew comes back and digs out the saw cut areas and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride. They are required to post 48 hours in advanced. We will make sure that we talk to the Engineers to emphasize that to the contractors.

The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector investigated and determined the following:. Our own Public Works Department is reconstructing Boylston St from Dartmouth to Exeter St. What you see is the contractor performing sidewalk work. Because the sidewalk is inaccessible while the work is taking place, the contractor has two options. Place a sidewalk closed signs on the ramps at Dartmouth St and Exeter and telling the people to cross the street. Since we find that people ignore the signs, where there is enough room we create a temporary path of travel in the street. That is what you see on Boylston St. They have placed temporary asphalt ramps for people with disabilities to leave the sidewalk and get on the road. We call for police details daily  for pedestrian safety and traffic control. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

{"service_request_id":"101002204088","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The Boston Public Works takes very seriously the responsibility of coordinating proposed paving projects with proposed utility street cut work. With old infrastructure and the explosion of development requiring service work, it is extremely challenging to coordinate our paving programs with utility street cut work. The City has identified 22 utility companies and other City departments who regularly perform street cut work. No street is paved unless all 22 entities clear the street. In 2009 the Boston PWD created an online reservation system called the City Of Boston Utility Coordination Software (COBUCS). No utility company, private contractor, site plan engineer, or City department can receive a permit without first entering the work into COBUCS. COBUCS will inform whether the entry is in conflict with another entry. Since 2009 over 10,000 times, COBUCS has alerted the City and Permittees of a potential conflict. The City either held off the paving, or coordinated the work to get done before paving took place. That is 10,000 less cuts on guaranteed streets. We did get a conflict for service work at #23 recently.  That is why the engineer skipped the final paving of that section of Chickatawbut  to allow the utility work to take place. Once the work is done, we will come back and finish the paving that we held off. We apologize for the inconvenience. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,.

{"service_request_id":"101002204718","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. Utility companies and private contractors obviously need permission (permits) from any City or Town to perform work on their streets. Depending on the scope of the work the permit may be for a few days, or a couple of months. They are required to post the street 48 hours before the work takes place. The sign indicates the dates of work allowed on the permit.  The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) realized in many cases the work maybe much less than the permit states, or they are moving down the street and not spending all the permitted time at that location. When a resident sees 30, 60, or 90 days on the sign it absolutely creates an instant overwhelming feeling of inconvenience in their minds. Where are they going to find parking for that amount of time? Again, instead the work maybe only a few days in front of the residence. This is why we tell the permittees that we want you as best as you can to only indicate the dates you are going to be working.  If you need a few extra days, then you change the dates.  Seeing 3 days or 5 days or 7 days is a lot easier to handle than the 30, 60, or 90 days. In this particular instance, we will talk to the contractor about the 6:00am start.
