The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) investigated and determined the following:. National Grid is replacing a gas main that is over 100 years old. In addition to replacing a 100 year old main National Grid is replacing every gas service to each resident. The City highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs.   Especially if we plan on paving the street in the future. The City acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However replacing mains over 100 years old ensures solid dependable gas service for another 100 years. We have instructed Feeney not to have their trucks idle before work starts. In addition, because of the tight parking on Houghton St, we have asked them not to work on Saturdays.
