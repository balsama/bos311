Bang! Bang! On my car, I thought someone hit the car, I turned and it was a meter maid.\n\nShe was yelling move, move, very intimidatingly. She was weaving this thing in her hand for me to see. Threatening me with a ticket.  I was trying to roll down my window to tell her okay, but she was yelling so much I guess I did not take off fast enough for her. OMG this lady was going bananas.\n\nI was able to get my window rolled down to say okay, she said move now, I was like really, and she pointed to a paper sign and said the sign says no parking. I noticed the sign and it said no parking filming.\n\nI am in the car with my hazard lights on for not even a minute. There was a car sitting behind me parked.  I was just confirming that my daughter was able to be seen at the dentist office.\n\nI guess because I did not speed, she was yelling weaving her hands like a crazy person. I wasn\u2019t going speed off putting myself or anyone else in danger. She said I'm going to give you a ticket I said what?  I shook my head and said okay give me the ticket I will request a hearing. She said go ahead.\n\nI got out of the car to get the ticket, I asked her to hand me the ticket and she yelled no, no and put the ticket on my car.\n\nI walked to the right side of the car to get the ticket and she said now I am going to get your car towed, I was like really, and I called 911 to notify the police that I was being harassed by badge #278\n\nI spoke to the officer and was given this number to call 617-635-3900. I spoke to a women, and I told her the story. She then gave me your contact \n\nHer aggressive approach, her intimidating tone, it's unacceptable, also her pounding on my car very unacceptable. Badge #278 threaten me, as well as punished me with a $75.00 ticket.\n\nIs this how meter maids conduct themselves these days? If so, I believe training is needed.","requested_datetime":"2018-02-14T07:44:36-05:00","updated_datetime":"2018-02-19T13:44:33-05:00","address":"29 Commonwealth Ave, Ste 101, Boston","lat":42.3534258004337,"long":-71.07433152549986,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/5a842f270485edeff97be022/report.jpg"},

{"service_request_id":"101002366879","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent. National Grid is installing a new main on your street. The city highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs. The city acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However in the long run the construction is well worth it. Having a street dug up for emergency repairs soon after paving is frustrating for all. With the new gas main installed, the city can feel extremely comfortable that no embarrassing street cuts will happen if it determines to pave your street in the future. Even though the contactor will installing a new main usually for hundreds of feet and in some cases the entire street, we have told the contractor to only post where he will be for the next week or so. This will allow more parking on the street. I have reached out to National Grid and Feeney Brothers and told them they must post 48 hours before they work at that location as they move down the street. I also told them that I was disappointed in the way your elderly Grandmother was treated. I have asked that they reach out to you regarding that treatment and your ticket situation. If you do not hear back from National Grid by Monday afternoon you can call Peter Nagle at 617-293-1490. We apologize for the inconvenience this necessary work will cause. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

This is one of several complaints that have been on going since the work has started. My car has been ticketed because of their negligence of proper signage which I now have to pay to appeal because they aren't doing their job properly. Not only that but my elderly grandmother's car was towed because once again they have moved their signs the day of the construction rather than given proper notice and when she went to do her errands she was treated disrespectfully and told she should have 'read the signs'. I am dumb founded by such utter disrespect for not only the residence but to a senior citizen. It's a shame that the people who live here have been unable to park their vehicles in front of their homes.","requested_datetime":"2018-02-08T10:43:32-05:00","updated_datetime":"2018-02-09T08:33:48-05:00","address":"183 Leyden St, East Boston","lat":42.38856719999999,"long":-71.00469689999998},
