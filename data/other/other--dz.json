Everybody assumes the pedestrian cross request button doesn't work, so nobody ever pushes it, and as a result, pedestrians and bicycles both ignore the light and cross whenever the feel they can.  I commute the SW Corridor by bike every day and I can't even count the number of near disasters I've seen at this intersection.  It would be dramatically improved if the new crosswalk buttons that have a light and audible confirmation when pressed were installed here.
