YOU DUMB F*CK\"). There was a Jeep Wrangler pressed up against my back bumper, scratching and compressing it, leaving some permanent damage. The Jeep has a Mass. registration of 025 T with a disabled plate and includes the following message on the back window of its soft top/canopy: \"STOLZER AM I PROUD KRAUT.\" I quickly exited the scene because it was late, I didn't want to make scene and risk an unsafe confrontation, and I  needed to get the message off my car to be able to see and drive safely. Sadly I don't have pictures of the message, but I have pictures of the physical damage to my car. While it may be too late to fix my problem, this person did not need to do this.

They left gates open and sprinklers running with hoses creating obstacles for the kids to negotiate when playing on the new play structures. The bigger concern was the workers left and hoses were running from the water panel where they left the cover open. A tool box was on the ground in there as well as a plastic bag containing small parts which is a major choking hazard for young kids. A photo is attached. No workers were to be found anywhere within eye sight of the playground when this was left open and by that time is was past 10am and the playground was packed with young children.

We have received a few emails from neighbors concerning the safety of the newly renovated Medal of Honor Park playground in South Boston.  Our main goal is to provide safe, fun, multi-use play spaces for all Boston's residents and visitors to enjoy. The new playground is equipped with a 2-5 year old play area that has 2,100 square feet of play space that includes a climbing structure, swings and spring riders.  It also has a 5-12 year old 4,150 play area that includes a play structure and swings. As part of the design and construction process, the project must meet or exceed several safety standards before it is opened to the public for use. These include:. A certified safety inspector (CPSI) is brought onto the team to ensure that the equipment and design conform to national safety standards as developed by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). The play equipment approved for the project is required to be a manufacturer certified playground installer. The play surfacing is required to meet ASTM and International Play Equipment Manufacturer's Association (IPEMA) safety standards before it is opened to the public. The splash pad is also a multi-use performance space which will allow for year round programming such as puppet shows and small musical performances as desired by the community and expressed through the community meeting process. The concrete surface for water play is used across the City parks. Through years of park design and development, material performance has been observed and the safest options are installed. The concrete has shown to be more slip resistant when wet, durable to prevent tripping hazards, and has a lower temperature range resulting in less injury and burns. The Parks Department has notified both the design firm and playground manufacturer of the community's concerns. Parks takes these concerns seriously and will be hiring a third party independent playground safety inspector to conduct an audit of the constructed playground.

{"service_request_id":"101002147502","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Noted. We have received a few emails from neighbors concerning the safety of the newly renovated Medal of Honor Park playground in South Boston.  Our main goal is to provide safe, fun, multi-use play spaces for all Boston's residents and visitors to enjoy. The new playground is equipped with a 2-5 year old play area that has 2,100 square feet of play space that includes a climbing structure, swings and spring riders.  It also has a 5-12 year old 4,150 play area that includes a play structure and swings. As part of the design and construction process, the project must meet or exceed several safety standards before it is opened to the public for use. These include:. A certified safety inspector (CPSI) is brought onto the team to ensure that the equipment and design conform to national safety standards as developed by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). The play equipment approved for the project is required to be a manufacturer certified playground installer. The play surfacing is required to meet ASTM and International Play Equipment Manufacturer's Association (IPEMA) safety standards before it is opened to the public. The splash pad is also a multi-use performance space which will allow for year round programming such as puppet shows and small musical performances as desired by the community and expressed through the community meeting process. The concrete surface for water play is used across the City parks. Through years of park design and development, material performance has been observed and the safest options are installed. The concrete has shown to be more slip resistant when wet, durable to prevent tripping hazards, and has a lower temperature range resulting in less injury and burns. The Parks Department has notified both the design firm and playground manufacturer of the community's concerns. Parks takes these concerns seriously and will be hiring a third party independent playground safety inspector to conduct an audit of the constructed playground. We appreciate your concern and will continue to monitor this playground to ensure it meets universal safety standards. Sincerely,. --. Michele Folts. Project Manager for the City of Boston.
