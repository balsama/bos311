{"service_request_id":"101001127597","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Noted. Dear Citizens Connect user:  Attached is the response received from the Greenway Conservancy.  I hope this info is helpful. The four trees in question at the Greenway Carousel are not dead, but rather showing signs of elevated stress. They are Gymnocladus dioicus  -   Kentucy Coffee Tree. They were planted last year along with the surrounding Gleditsias to create a mixed species grove effect for the Carousel. All of the plant material including the trees in the grove and surrounding new Carousel landscape are under warranty by the installer and have been and will continue to be evaluated for their health and appearance. A mutual decision involving the Greenway Conservancy and those parties involved with the design and installation of the Carousel landscape has already resulted in having 6 of the Gleditsias replaced earlier this season in the grove as well as other surrounding plant material as part of the warranty agreement at no additional cost to the Conservancy. Due to the harsh winter and late arrival of Spring, the Kentucky Coffee Trees, which are known to be slow to emerge in spring after the best of winter conditions, are still being evaluated by representatives of all of the interested parties, including the Conservancy. Highly respected individuals in the field of Landscape Design, Arboriculture and Horticulture have all suggested that a little longer of a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach be taken to see if the trees will finally adjust to their new surrounds and rebound from the previous winter. A decision will be forthcoming soon as to whether they will remain or be replaced under the warranty agreement and what the timing schedule will be. Thank you!","service_name":"Other","service_code":"4f38920fe75084437f0001a0","description":"Four dead trees at carousel please replace..It's hot here!","requested_datetime":"2014-07-13T15:06:56-04:00","updated_datetime":"2014-07-22T12:03:10-04:00","address":"563 Atlantic Ave, Boston","lat":42.360401,"long":-71.052861},
