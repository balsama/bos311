The trouble is that for our specific area, we need some resident-only restriction at night as well, and perhaps some No Standing signs. One neighbor runs a business out of his house (whether licensed or not I do not know), and it regularly causes traffic tie-ups and a dearth of spaces as parents sit there for hours waiting for their kids to be done. \n\nIt's even worse in the winter, since he has a driveway and NEVER shovels the streets spaces in front of his house, so his clients constantly park and sit in their cars in the spaces we had to shovel out (leaving us no place to park). This neighbor clearly does not care about this impact on the rest of the neighborhood; it's been brought to his attention repeatedly and nothing has changed.\n\nIs there any sort of remedy for this? This influx several times a week of non-resident cars just idling in front of our house has gotten worse, and we're really tired of it.\n\nThank you","requested_datetime":"2019-01-21T19:50:32-05:00","updated_datetime":"2019-01-21T19:50:00-05:00","address":"63 Patten St, Jamaica Plain","lat":42.29334700856571,"long":-71.1151509639538},
