This will eliminate possible future emergency gas leaks. . Since workers need to go into the pipe itself to internally seal the joints, numerous plates are required for this job. . The City acknowledges that this has been a hardship for the neighborhood, trying to secure all the plates on a very busy street is challenging. . It is still no excuse, and we have told the contractor to take every measure and step necessary in order to have those plates properly secured at the end of each shift. . The Construction Inspector( CIU) drove the all of the plates today and found that they were properly secured and there was no banging. We have scheduled a meeting for Tuesday in the field  to discuss how they can do a better job  securing the plates. We will stay on top of the contractor. The work is expected to be completed by no later than November 15th. The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work caused. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

{"service_request_id":"101001184420","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Resolved. The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving. It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes. The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride. The street is leafleted before the work begins where it explains that it is a mufti phase construction operation and you should look at the dates since they will change as each construction phases progresses. Our goal is to allow parking between phases and not post the street for the entire time the work takes place. This is why the contractor repeatedly changes the dates. Since this is a patching contract, the contractor may only be on your street for only a short period of time; giving the appearance of not showing up. Sometimes poor weather, plant breakdowns, or equipment failure occurs which results in the delay of the upcoming work. The CIU spoke to the contractor about his need to do a better job on changing the dates when those situations arise. The street will be topped in the next few days. The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.
