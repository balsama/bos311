I felt the gas feeling with my stomach and threw up three times with fever. I tried the gas release medication but it's not working. I couldn't pass any of gas and I couldn't sleep for whole night. At the second day I find my right leg couple trample on the floor with pain. So I went to MGH on Friday which is June 17 2017. I suppose to go to emergency room but they send to a walk in clinic, which name is wang clinic. I talked with doctor about all my issue and told him I suspect I have some infection problem inside my belly. He told me I have no fever, which is showed 71f on my doctor note. I insist to do the blood checking and belly ct scan but he said it's waste money and time. He said my problem just food poisoning, which is not a big deal. My friend who went with my asked him do blood check and Ct scan for second time but he rejected again. He did find out my right lower belly tightness and didn't realize anything. He sent me home with pain medication and told me will be fine in two days. \nAfter two days, the pain medication is not working on me anymore. I went northeastern university health center on June 20 2016. After five minutes talk, the doctor told me that my problem is a very serious problem for appendicitis and transfer me to BIDMC. I did a blood check and ct scan in their emergency room and they told me that my appendix has already open with blood poisoning. Then I stay in the hospital for two weeks and did a surgery on June 28 2016. They cut part of my large and small intestine because of the infection and I have blood clot problem in that time. I go back home from hospital at July 3rd 2016. \nRight now, I'm doing good from surgery but there are some problems for me after this problem. I have a diarrhea always at least three time a day and always liquids. I couldn't hold them, when I feel that I need to rush to restroom and I can exactly know what did I eat from it. I couldn't do any sports because it will make my belly pain. It bring me lost a lot of money for both medical payment and also my school and living expenses because of the medical leave extend my program as a international student. I experience everything almost myself because I have no family here.   I do have all doctor record for what I said above. If you are interested in it. Please call me. My number is 617-784-9098\nThere is no lawyer want to help me because MGH didn't do any check for me even though I insist to do it. I get medical malpractice because of no actions from them and I couldn't prove my situation because of no actions from them as well. I really don't know what can I do for it. Is it any help I can get from here?","requested_datetime":"2017-04-13T15:04:40-04:00","updated_datetime":"2017-04-13T16:06:20-04:00","address":"250 Maple St, Chelsea","lat":42.39895529999999,"long":-71.03729449999999},
