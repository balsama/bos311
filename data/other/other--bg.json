The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) know one of its most important responsibilities is to make sure utilities and private contractors are following our no parking procedures. For example:Some jobs will require installing a new main usually for hundreds of feet and in some cases the entire street, we have told the utility companies and private contractors to only post where they will be for the next week or so. This will allow more parking on the street. The City's goal is to provide as much marking as possible during construction. We have provided them labels to change the dates as they move down the street. In this particular case we will talk to Verizon and make sure that the signs that were previously posted had the dates changed to reflect the new work dates. If this wasn't the case, we will have them take the signs down and repost. We did tell utility companies and contractors that there was no work from the 23rd-26th to allow residents to enjoy the long Thanksgiving weekend without construction. This may have contributed to the confusion. We apologize for the inconvenience you incurred. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.
