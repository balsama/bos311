{"service_request_id":"101002072700","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving. It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes. The utility work previously done on your street was left with a temporary patch. The City of Boston does not want the permanent asphalt cross section (typically 6.5\" on residential street and 7.5\"on main arterials) to be put back soon after the gravel down to the pipe has been disturbed. There is a possibility that settlement could occur. That?s why the City waits before performing the cross section repair.  Our permanent patches hardly ever settle and that is the goal that any City or Town would want to happen regarding utility excavation work. We do have a unit that inspects backfilling and temporary patches (The Construction Inspection Unit CIU) The CIU does stay on top of the contractors and utility companies.  Many of the temporary patches are in good condition. However, the key is the patch is only 3\".  We need the full cross section put back. Below is the steps taken to do the permanent repair. The construction process is to dig out 6.5 to 7.5\" inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride. In regards to your complaint we have spoken to the contractor and asked that they do a better job cleaning up the work zone at the end of the day. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

For major projects in the City of Boston National Grid notifies the affected residents via mail of the upcoming work. It tells the reason why, and the contact names and phone numbers to call if needed. I emailed National Grid who told me they sent it out on March 1st. You can talk to the National Grid representative Peter Nagel at 617-293-1490 to discuss further. As for the work itself, National Grid is replacing a gas main that is over 100 years old. In addition to replacing a 100 year old main National Grid is replacing every gas service to each resident/business. The City highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs.   Especially if we plan on paving the street in the future. The City acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However replacing mains over 100 years old ensures solid dependable gas service for another 100 years.

{"service_request_id":"101002025591","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Noted. Thank you for contacting the Boston Transportation Department. Stop signs are present on Wrentham St (the minor approach) which cedes the right of way to those on Florida St. Corner restrictions are present on Florida St to allow for those on Wrentham St to have clear sight lines to judge for the appropriate time to pull out. . Please know that federal criteria in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) prevents cities and towns from installing stop signs for speed control (Section 2B.04). Stop signs installed for speed control in the past have been found to be counterproductive, and have increased mid-block speeds between stop signs and reduced compliance at stop signs. BTD is currently in the process of implementing the Neighborhood Slow Streets program for traffic calming in two pilot areas. We have developed an application process so that other neighborhoods can benefit from traffic calming and reduced speeds on their streets. The application is available at https://www.boston.gov/transportation/neighborhood-slow-streets.  You can learn more about the program at visionzeroboston.org/nss. We suggest that you also add any additional concerns to our ?safety issues? map at the following link: app01.cityofboston.gov/VZSafety/. To get updates in your inbox, please join the mailing list at visionzeroboston.org/contact.","service_name":"Other","service_code":"4f38920fe75084437f0001a0","description":"Need 4way STOP SIGN, multiple car ACCIDENTS, cars speeding.","requested_datetime":"2017-02-26T10:25:22-05:00","updated_datetime":"2017-04-25T11:08:01-04:00","address":"Intersection Of Florida St & Wrentham St, Dorchester","lat":42.28843,"long":-71.058629},

The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) investigated and determined the following:. National Grid is replacing a gas main that is over 100 years old. In addition to replacing a 100 year old main National Grid is replacing every gas service to each resident/business. The City highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs.   Especially if we plan on paving the street in the future. The City acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However replacing mains over 100 years old ensures solid dependable gas service for another 100 years. The permit is valid from 9:30-3:30 Monday - Friday. If they want to work on Saturdays they will have to go to Boston Transportation Department and amend the permit to work Saturdays. The inspector will monitor the worksite to ensure full compliance with the City's rules. Any trench that is not smooth and level at the end of the job we will require the contractor to mill and pave the trench over. Again the City apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

Emergency work must be performed no matter what time of day or night in the interest of public safety and the protection of private property. This proved to be a very difficult repair, resulting in National Grid working into the night. The Inspector states they did have sidewalk closed signs indicating to the pedestrians they had to cross to the other side while emergency work took place. We will contact National Grid to make sure signs are at the nearest crosswalks on either side of the work at all times. National Grid always calls for a police detail. The police could have showed up and been around the corner or the detail request was not filled. We will pass your concerns on to the police if that were the case. The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work caused. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

Please know that federal criteria in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) prevents cities and towns from installing stop signs for speed control (Section 2B.04). Stop signs installed for speed control in the past have been found to be counterproductive, and have increased mid-block speeds between stop signs and reduced compliance at stop signs. BTD is currently in the process of implementing the Neighborhood Slow Streets program for traffic calming in two pilot areas. We have developed an application process so that other neighborhoods can benefit from traffic calming and reduced speeds on their streets. The application is available at https://www.boston.gov/transportation/neighborhood-slow-streets.  You can learn more about the program at visionzeroboston.org/nss. We suggest that you also add any additional concerns to our ?safety issues? map at the following link: app01.cityofboston.gov/VZSafety/.
