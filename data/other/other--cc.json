Thus, a car that is waiting to turn left must wait for the right of way from oncoming traffic traveling northbound on West Newton St. before turning, preventing any traffic behind it that wishes to turn right from doing so, which causes the backup. A solution would be to create separate right and left turn lanes markings at the intersection so that right turning traffic can freely turn and avoid having to wait for left turn traffic to turn.  The space is already available for two turn lanes. Parking is prohibited on the southbound side of West Newton St from 8am-6pm.

{"service_request_id":"101001967828","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. As I stated over the phone with you, the paving condition of Blue Hill Ave is a top priority for the City. Before any paving can take place, the Public Works wants to make sure that any utility work needed is done first. Obviously that makes sense. The Public Works has built an online reservation system were everyone who wants to do construction work has to enter it into the database first. Conflicts are flagged and coordination can take place. This  helps eliminates embarrassing street cuts after a street has been paved. Since the creation of the online reservation system we have flagged over 10,000 conflicts, with a savings of over $30 Million dollars that would have been spent on repairing cuts on brand new roadways. Blue Hill Ave has had major utility work over the last few years, including new gas mains, which is a plus for the neighborhood. There is still more utility work planned for Blue Hill Ave. We have identified some of the utility work that does not meet our standards and requested that repairs be made. .  Some of the repairs have been done, and the remaining locations will be done shortly. Mayor Walsh understands how important dependable utility service is to our residents. He also understands that it is important we make sure the utilities follow our rules, and do a good job. . You can contact the number below sometime before the Spring and we can give you a definitive update on the sections of Blue Hill Ave we want to pave in 2017. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.
