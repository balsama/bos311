Unfortunately the city removed the trees rather than put in well covers. My goal wasn't to have the trees removed, we need more trees in downtown Boston. But be that as it may. Now there are two empty trees pits and the color of the material in the pit is very like the color of the sidewalk so now many people are stepping into the tree pit and potentially hurting their ankles or knees. So can the city either put in new trees and use the iron covers to cover the tree wells, like the other trees on Summer St or fill in the tree pits so that people aren't potential hurting themselves.

{"service_request_id":"101002179186","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector investigated and determined the following. Verizon plans on offering FIOS to the  residents of Dorchester. Before they can install the conduit, they need to check the existing conduit to see if the new fiber can be installed. This is called  occupancy work and it is done between manholes.  No digging is involved. If they determine there are sections blocked then they need to install new conduit.   That is what you are seeing on your street. In order to have the best final paving product, the city allows the utility company to leave the base course down low for a few days to allow the lift to set up properly in preparation for the final top course. What you observed was the repair in the binder base course phase. The top course is scheduled to be done  soon. The Inspector will make sure that  on the no parking signs  the dates are accurate on when they are coming back  to perform the top course. This will allow you to monitor when you can and cannot park. We will talk to Verizon and make sure they are adhering to that requirement 100% of the time. We apologize for the inconvenience the work caused. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance. Boston Public Works Department. 617-635-4951. The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector states that after the Verizon contractor installs the conduit and backfills the excavation he places a base mix of hot mix asphalt. Within a few days they come back and place the top course of hot mix asphalt. The are in question was topped yesterday and is now level.
