{"service_request_id":"101002177430","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) investigated and determined the following:. National Grid is replacing a gas main that is over 100 years old. In addition to replacing a 100 year old main National Grid is replacing every gas service to each resident/business. The City highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs.   Especially if we plan on paving the street in the future. The City acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However replacing mains over 100 years old ensures solid dependable gas service for another 100 years. National Grid is required to send letters to each of the residents before the construction starts informing them of the job and contact information. The National Grid Public Relations Rep Peter Nagle can be contacted at 617-293-1490.  The CIU Inspector for your neighborhood is  Mal Flynn 781-983-4201.  The contractor contact is Ronan Feeney of Feeney Brothers.  Ronans number is 617-590-5973. Call Mal this morning to make sure that the police officer allows you to park in the parking lot within the work zone. Obviously where they are doing the work, there will be no parking for the hours posted. Again the City apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.

This gives the Boston residences another option for cable, phone and computer services. Thats why they are on your street. First, Verizon has to go into its manholes on every street it wants to offer Fios and make sure that the conduit is in good working order to install the new fiber. That is why you see the trucks occupying the manholes while inspecting the existing conduit. Usually the occupancy work can be done very quickly but sometimes it can be for an extended period of time. Verizon does have an Occupancy to work Nights in your neighborhood. We will contact Verizon to make sure thaty they take every step to try to minimize the inconvenience to the public that the work causes. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

Pedestrians who step onto the crosswalk are coming from dedicated walking, jogging, and biking paths. Joggers and walkers are very often listening to headphones, and people on dedicated pedestrian paths without motor vehicles are more likely to be looking at their phones as they walk. People using this crosswalk are often tourists or visitors not familiar with the immediate area.
