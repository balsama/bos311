{"service_request_id":"101002120190","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) investigated and determined the following. Eversource Electric had an oil leak on its transmission line. This transmission line is critical for the power supply to South Boston. Eversource has been working ever since to rectify this critical situation. This was not planned work. They totally understand and regret the tremendous impact they are having on the residents near this work. That is why they flyered the neighborhood explaining the situation. They have had to place stationary work zones along the route of the repair. This is to protect the workers and the public. They have police details and Eversource Supervisors who are allowing residents access in and out. Public Works and the Transportation Department also understand the inconvenience to the South Boston residents for this necessary work and we also apologize. There is a 24 hour project hotline number 617-541-7634 if you needed something addressed right away. If you want to reach out to Eversource to discuss this matter further you can email John Hoey at John.Hoey@eversource.com. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below.

The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector investigated and determined the following:. One of your neighbors has a sewer break at 65 Sawyer Ave,. That is why the work is being done. We spoke to the contractor and told him the only person that can shutdown a street is the police officer on detail. He told me he calls for police details and the never show up. He told me they are not there again today.  I told him he has to open up the street or shutdown for the day, which obviously we do not want to do because of the sewer break. He will open up the street.

{"service_request_id":"101002107604","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. Before the Public Works Department resurfaces any street in Boston it requires 22 utility companies and City Agencies to review the street to determine if they have any proposed utility work. If there is no proposed future planned work we require each entity to sign off that the street can be paved.  Once the street has been fully signed off the City does not want anyone to dig the street for a 5 year period.  We now call the street a Guaranteed Street. In order to have the most effective clearance review, Public Works created an online database that reserves construction work. The City of Boston Utility Coordination Software (COBUCS)  will not allow any construction work to take place until it has been entered into COBUCS. It has been a breakthrough for coordination and has alerted the City over 10,000 times at a savings of over $35 Million in paving costs. . Unfortunately either because of emergency work or the explosion of development we have had our guaranteed streets dug into.  It is frustrating but it also shows how vibrant and an attractive city Boston is that people want to expand their businesses or live in our City. If you cut into a guaranteed street you are required to restore the street 25 feet on either side of the cut. That is what you saw on Granger St. The City is not responsible for any of the costs.  It is strictly the permittee who applies for a guaranteed street cut waiver. I know it is a long explanation, but I hope it gives you a clearer picture.  For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.
