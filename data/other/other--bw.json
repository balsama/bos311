{"service_request_id":"101002085896","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) investigated and determined the following:. National Grid is replacing a gas main that is over 100 years old. In addition to replacing a 100 year old main National Grid is replacing every gas service to each resident/business. The City highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs.   Especially if we plan on paving the street in the future. The City acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However replacing mains over 100 years old ensures solid dependable gas service for another 100 years. Depending on the scope of work, part of or all of the street, may be posted at one time. To ensure as much parking as possible during construction we have instructed the contractor to only post the sections of the street that they will be working within the next week. This is why you see the contractors changing the dates on the signs.  If the work becomes more complicated than thought, they extended the no parking date. Or they move the signs down the street as the work progresses. This will allow more parking for the residents during construction. The CIU inspector will monitor the postings. Again the City apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.
