They are usually driving pretty fast and are probably trying to avoid traffic at Brighton Center.  This is a huge safety concern because a significant number of students walk to school or are dropped off and use the crosswalk to cross Dighton St.  There is a crossing guard there at 9;15, but several students arrive earlier than that for the morning BOKS exercise program that starts at 8:30.  There is not a crossing guard at this time. Just this morning in the 2 minutes it took me to drop off my son, 14 cars zipped past me--none of them slowed down for the crosswalk.  The best solution would be to install a speed hump or bump halfway up the hill so cars slow down before the crosswalk.  If it saves one child's life, it will be worth it.  Please don't wait to do this until someone is either hurt or killed by someone cutting through the school zone.","requested_datetime":"2018-05-01T19:23:12-04:00","updated_datetime":"2018-05-01T19:23:00-04:00","address":"46 Dighton St, Brighton","lat":42.34768685273024,"long":-71.1547007904369},

The photo shown is not of the incident but was taken shortly thereafter. The operator of the truck was waiting at the red light on Pearl St, traveling North as it turns into Congress. He aggressively lurched forward a full 5 seconds before the light changed in an effort to box out the car in the left travel lane. In doing so, he did not notice or see the cyclist traveling east on Water st who had a green light and ample time to clear the intersection. This \"cowboy\" operator - male African American appx 35 y/o needs to not be allowed to drive if he is so aggressive and has such little regard for public safety.","requested_datetime":"2018-05-01T14:52:44-04:00","updated_datetime":"2018-05-01T14:52:00-04:00","address":"Intersection Of Pearl St & Water St, Boston","lat":42.35752862181595,"long":-71.05640034897226,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/5ae8b75175051ea355858078/report.jpg"},
