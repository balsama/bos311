I did not answer the door, but I was home working downstairs.  A minute later, the same man began knocking on the door.  Again, I did not answer, as I was working downstairs.  Approximately one hour later, the same individual returned to my house, again rang the door bell and then proceeded to knock on my door.  Again, I did not answer.  Later that same day, on or around 6:45 p.m. as I was watering the plants in my front yard the same individual approached me and came on to my property.  He was the same white man appeared to be in his mid 20s, wearing a Verizon hat.  I noticed he was wearing a silver chain.  As he approached, I said \u201cthank you but I\u2019m not interested\u201d assuming he was trying to sell me something.  He replied in an aggressive manner that he was not trying to sell anything, and asked if my husband was home, which gave me cause for concern as I was home alone and he had been at my house several times that day.  I asked him to please leave, that he had already been at my house twice already today and that I was not interested and asked me to leave.  I said this as I was walking to my front door.  He was very rude and dismissive, and said that I was wrong and that he had not been to my house that day.  I said yes, you rang the doorbell and knocked on the door two different times.  I again asked him to leave.  He then said that he had a special offer and that if I did not sign I would lose out on some benefit for my Verizon account, or something bad would happen to my account.  I told him to leave again and shut the door. I just wanted to have this reported somewhere because I have no idea who this person was, if they worked for Verizon, and the fact that they were at my house observing me and came three times in such a short period is very disturbing.  Also, he was extremely aggressive and unprofessional, and wanted to know if I was alone, which made me highly suspicious and very nervous.","requested_datetime":"2018-07-10T21:23:34-04:00","updated_datetime":"2018-07-10T21:23:00-04:00","address":"794 Vfw Pkwy, West Roxbury","lat":42.29104174690211,"long":-71.16681332840402},
