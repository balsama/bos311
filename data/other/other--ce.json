{"service_request_id":"101001961473","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. National Grid is installing a new gas main.  The city encourages this type of capital upgrade work.  It will provide dependable gas service to the residents as well as  eliminate future emergency repairs. The city acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However in the long run the placement of a new gas main is well worth it.  National Grid has to install the gas main first.  Once the main has been installed, then all service connections can be made. If the city were to make National Grid pave to grade each day's trench work,  it would cause multiple seams along the trench. More importantly, every service connection needs to be cut into the trench.  If we were to pave the trench every day,  this would result in 2 by 2 patches inside the trench area, resulting in a very poor final product. In order to have the best final paving, the city allows the utility company to leave the trench down low until all service connections are made and then pave the trench all at once, resulting in a smooth, level final trench repair. Service laterals are topped within 24 hours of excavation. What the constituent is observing is the trench left down low in preparation for one continuous final paving operation. We do require that the contractor place florescent orange signs ahead of the construction informing motorists that the trench ahead is down low. The work is expected to be completed within 2 weeks. If you have any questions you can call the Inspector Jessica Porder   at 781-603-9921. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

{"service_request_id":"101001953166","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. National Grid is installing a new gas mains  in your neighborhood.  These gas mains could be almost 100 years old, and obviously need replacement.  The city highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs. The city acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However in the long run the construction is well worth it. Having a street dug up for emergency repairs soon after paving is frustrating for all. With the new gas main installed, the city can feel extremely comfortable that no embarrassing street cuts will happen if it determines to pave your street in the future. The work is almost complete, they need to tie in the services to the homes along the new replacement limits. Any trench that is not smooth and level at the end of the job we will require the contractor to mill and pave the trench over. The inspector will monitor the worksite to ensure full compliance with the city's rules. The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.
