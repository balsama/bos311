Mark my words - you are going to be looking at a pedestrian Vs. bus or pedestrian Vs. snow plow or Truck Vs Bike accident a fatality here at some point. There is just too much going on here, too narrow and no proper look at how traffic enters this spot from all available directions. There was NEVER any traffic counting or surveying done here at all.

The City of Boston and the Transportation Department are aware that parking is at a premium throughout the city. However, the Transportation Department's first priority is public safety and it was brought to our attention that cars where forced to drive in the wrong direction on Douglas St because they could not turn right when exiting the parking lot on the back. In order to prevent an incident, we decided that the best approach to correct this issue was installing a parking restriction sign to provide enough space for cars to successfully exit the parking spaces on the back. Again, we understand that parking is limited but the sign was not meant to hurt residents but to improve public safety.","service_name":"Other","service_code":"4f38920fe75084437f0001a0","description":"A new Tow Zone sign was added to our small street, that already has limited parking, taking away another parking spot on Douglas Street. I understand the residents who live behind the building at 3 Douglas (and have parking spots) complained about not being able to turn out onto Douglas Street because of cars parked there. I'm asking if the Tow Zone sign can be please be moved closer to the end of the curb so that you can still park a car on Douglas Street yet still leaves enough space for the residents in the back to be able to turn out onto Douglas. It find it very unfair that a Tow Zone sign was put up again taking away another parking space on my street. I live here with 3 small children and parking is already a challenge.

It is along the MBTA bus stop where the 66 (going towards Harvard) picks up passengers. This pothole tends to fill up with water and it is so deep I don't think MBTA drivers can tell how deep it is if the bus pulls up towards it. There is more and more erosion with this pothole that you can see more layers within the infrastructure. Other neighboring potholes have been patched up as mentioned in previous tickets.
