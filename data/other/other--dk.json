When the City is hit with a major snow storm, its first responsibly is to keep the roads open and passable during the storm. Its second responsibility is after the storm has passed is to remove snow banks from locations where the public safety could be compromised. Atlantic Ave is one of those locations. Removing snow during the day with the normal traffic would be almost impossible. This is why major snow removal operations are done at night. The City acknowledges the major inconvenience of this operation.  But we do it in the best interest of the public. The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.
