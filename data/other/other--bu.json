I made a previous 311 complaint 101002076928 on May 1 that was inexplicably closed without any reason given.  Since then, construction has continued daily, including driving screws through neighboring units walls, shutting down the buildings water supply without notice to other occupants to do plumbing work, and installing vinyl windows that almost certainly do not meet south end historical standards.  In addition, when complaints were made to unit 1's owner, he said people should mind their own business.  Since then, he put a covering over the plate glass window presumably to keep people from seeing the permit less construction within.  See attached pic for both obscured plate glass and vinyl windows.

I audibly heard the cyclist catch herself with one hand against the body of a stopped car to avoid falling over as the bus squeezed past her with mere inches to spare. She was doing nothing wrong, and has every right to share the rose with cars and buses. It was dismaying to see a BPS bus driver making such and unsafe maneuver. I would hope the this driver is given a warning and that school buses are advised to give bikes the lane or pass with at least 3-feet of buffer between their immense vehicles and a cyclist.
