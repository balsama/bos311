The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector has identified that vault on the sidewalk needing attention as the responsibility of Eversource Electric. Replacing or repairing vaults is not an easy repair. Eversource has to have the vaults custom made for each seperate location. This takes time.  In addition the construction itself is technical and involved, as well as expensive. We have informed Eversource Electric that they have to set aside resources to repair vaults around the City. The estimated time for replacement is 6-9 months. However, we will require Eversource to make a temporary repair such as the use of asphalt, especially if it is a major tripping hazard. The temporary repair should be done within 3 business days. For any questions or concern, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector investigated today and determined the following:. National Grid is in the process of installing a new gas main on Northampton St. The city encourages this type of capital upgrade work.  It will eliminate future emergency repairs. The contractor placed a beam underneath the plates the other day. The inspector states the plates have the required 18 \" coverage over the opening and are tight and secure. There is a slight deflection noise when a heavy truck goes over the plates. The plates will be removed and the lateral at this location backfilled and paved on Tuesday. Going forward for any more issues you can call the CIU inspector Mal Flynn 1-781-983-4201. Thank you for your patience for this necessary work. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

Broadway T station. Our assessment of both these stations, however indicates that both are in compliance with approved standards. We conducted a site visit of the Hubway station at W. Broadway and Dorchester St to ensure that the station was re-installed appropriately this season. We confirmed that the station exceeds our minimum standards.
