Having competition with Comcast and RCN is good for the residents of the City of Boston which includes myself. It's a major investment by Fios and they have been working neighborhood by neighborhood installing the conduit the last 2 years. That is why you see a lot of Fios work in Jamaica Plain. The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) spoke with Verizon and told them that there in house and contract employees when working in the City of Boston need to be professional and courteous when they interact with the public at all times. Verizon states that they knock on doors and require permission to work on private property. We also told them they need to abide by the Massachusetts idling laws while working in the City. We will forward your complaint to the Boston Police Department as well. Verizon plans on having a meeting with their employees and contractors to reemphasize  that they need to follow  not only their rules  but the City's rules as well. They will specifically bring up your issues. Any patch that settles will be identified by the CIU and Verizon will need to be repaired in April when the weather warms  up. We apologize for the inconvenience. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.
