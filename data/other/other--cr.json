{"service_request_id":"101001743400","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Closed. Case Noted. Thank you for your concern. While school may have not been in session, the 24hr count was in fact performed under real-life circumstances and in accordance with BTD and US-standard traffic study procedures. School in session would increase volumes during the morning and afternoon, but it would not change the speeds on the street. The distribution would remain the same or very close to the same. On any street, a number of factors guide how fast people naturally travel, including roadway width, geometry, and sight lines. This is not impacted by the volume of vehicles using the street. Your original request was for speed limit signs. BTD performs dozens of speed studies on residential streets each year and not one of them in our memory has shown an average speed of higher than 30mph, the statutory limit. We do understand that speeds lower than that are preferable and safer, however the speed limit is controlled by the State. As such, BTD is unable to install speed limit signs without state approval. We still believe, however, that installing one on this street would be counterproductive and increase speeds. No matter what actions are taken, there will always be a few outliers that speed, which is why this case was forwarded to Boston Police for speed enforcement. It has been noted that the double yellow centerline has faded on this street and a maintenance request was already forwarded to operations to have it restriped. We have found that the presence of a center line narrows the lane and lowers speeds.","service_name":"Other","service_code":"4f38920fe75084437f0001a0","description":"This speed study was done when school was out and half of Boston is away.

Thank you for reporting the marking conditions on Mass Ave. This portion of the street is part of this year?s Vision Zero focus corridors. As such, lane markings may be changed in the very near future. Replacing the existing thermoplastic markings before that time isn?t a prudent use of city funds.

They were loudly loading a big truck with construction debris. Their noise woke us and kept us awake for hours. I asked them to stop. They wouldn't so I called the police. They eventually did stop but I don't know if it was because of the police or because they had filled up their truck anyway. I contacted the company today. The woman (who said she was the one who pulls permits) said she would look into it. My past experience with situations like this (35 years woof living here) suggests that they might be at it again tonight if they haven't completed the job.

To cover the sound of the construction, American cannons, besieging Boston from another location, began a noisy bombardment of the outskirts of the city. By the morning, more than a dozen cannons from Fort Ticonderoga had been brought within the Dorchester Heights fortifications. British General Sir William Howe hoped to use the British ships in Boston Harbor to destroy the American position, but a storm set in, giving the Americans ample time to complete the fortifications and set up their artillery. Realizing their position was now indefensible, 11,000 British troops and some 1,000 Loyalists departed Boston by ship on March 17, sailing to the safety of Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nThe bloodless liberation of Boston by the Patriots brought an end to a hated eight-year British occupation of the city, known for such infamous events as the \u201cBoston Massacre,\u201d in which five colonists were shot and killed by British soldiers. The British fleet had first entered Boston Harbor on October 2, 1768, carrying 1,000 soldiers.
