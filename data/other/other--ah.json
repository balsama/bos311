I was there along with my friend and 4 kids under 5 it was our first time attending the tree lighting and we were nervous to bring our kids to such a big crowd. 3 different police officers helped us at different stages throughout the night. First to guide us where to go we had passes  , then a different officer guided us through the crowd after the show and again in the park street train station a different officer again helped get us to the train through the crowds and we didn't even ask for help they approached us to see if we needed assistance. They were all so friendly and helpful and they made our night a great success. Also the Christmas tree lighting itself was a great show and we had a great time overall we will be back next year for sure \nThanks again for a great night to all involved","requested_datetime":"2018-12-01T17:03:12-05:00","updated_datetime":"2018-12-01T17:03:00-05:00","address":"1b Charles St, Boston","lat":42.35503856500389,"long":-71.06611147669088},

I had asked for a sign because people were parking so close to my driveway. This is great that you put this in but the arrow is pointing that wrong way. Now it basically took away the entire parking spot on the street, whereas all we wanted was for people to not park too close to the driveway. So basically if we could get a new sign with an arrow in the other direction that would be great so the neighbors Aren't mad at us for taking away a spot.","requested_datetime":"2018-11-13T10:44:13-05:00","updated_datetime":"2018-11-23T16:56:24-05:00","address":"43 Sullivan St, Charlestown","lat":42.37856479660908,"long":-71.06573654727977,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/5beaf13a7505a9887cba9229/report.jpg"},

We make the best decisons possible with the information available. The forecast early on wednesday(the busiest travel day of the year) was a coating to 2 inches falling quickly with reduced visability between 4-6PM. We felt it was in the best interest of public safety to make sure all the main routes and hills were treated before the afternoon rush started. Had the snow materialized as predicted, it would've been very difficult for our trucks to get around. Once we got an updated forecast we stopped treatment. There were three possible outcomes, the one we have now that you are obviously unhappy with. Second outcome is snow materialized as forecasted and because the roads were treated ahead of time folks were able to safely travel to their destinations. Third outcome is us not treating roadways, snow as forecasted, roads a mess with accidents and disabled vehicles. So in closing, what we have today isn't the best, but it also isnt the worst.

It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes. The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course.  The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride. What you observed was the patch down in binder awaiting the final top course. The patches are scheduled to be topped early next week.  Any questions you call the City Engineer Martin Lee at. 617-755-9119.  I hope the explanation clarified your concerns. The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.

My boyfriend's car was towed this morning so we went to pick it up at Frontage rd. As we went to pay , the woman informed my boyfriend that he was 25 cents short of paying the whole amount. We looked around everywhere to find a quarter because they did not take any change smaller than a quarter. The woman who was taking the payment was very rude about it, so when we asked her what her employee ID number was, she refused to give it. All city employees at the tow lot have badge numbers or an ID number, we learned this from talking to Boston 311. For this reason, I would like to make a complaint to the supervisors of the transportation department. It is not fair if employees refuse to give their ID numbers because then no one will ever be held accountable for bad things. \nThe employee was and older woman with blonde hair.
