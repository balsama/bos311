The Boston Public Works Department did not issue a street opening permit to Spectra for the pipeline work. The Federal Government issued the permit which allows Spectra to work Monday through Saturday 7am to 7pm. The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) contacted Spectra and asked them why they were working Saturday night past 7pm and on Sunday.  They stated they had to do work on their substation on Grove St which is their private property.  They also stated that they tried to mitigate the noise through the use of sound blankets. They City informed Spectra going forward that if they were going to work on their private property they would notify the CIU 48 hours in advance. In addition, the City may have the noise levels measured to insure the decibel levels do not go above the City ordinance.  They agreed to those terms.
