The city highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs. The city acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However in the long run the construction is well worth it. Having a street dug up for emergency repairs soon after paving is frustrating for all. With the new gas main installed, the city can feel extremely comfortable that no embarrassing street cuts will happen if it determines to pave your street in the future. Even though the contactor will installing a new main usually for hundreds of feet and in some cases the entire street, we have told the contractor to only post where he will be for the next few days. This will allow more parking on the street. We spoke to the crew and told them they have to follow this requirement . They apologized and said they would comply going forward.

To see that this graffiti art was approved by the city is telling the girls of our community a very different thing. Sad. Our neighborhood is already overrun by graffiti and rats.
