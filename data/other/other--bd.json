This renovation and removal of the overpass project was supposed to improve things, right at the moment, it seems to have only made things much worse, as evidenced by the unbelievable back ups on walk hill and Bluehill Avenues.\n\nSome of the issue seems to stem from the way New Washington Street and the Jamaica way intersect at Forest Hills; Some of it appears to do with the way the new drop off and cab stand format sits on the roadway; another piece appears to be the way buses-particularly double length buses- now have to interact with the traffic and the street. I hope and expect that some of this will improve with time and familiarity, but it certainly does not seem to be in very good shape right now. The buses doing all kinds of illegal things and going through red lights blocking intersections definitely does not help either.\n\nI would fully expect that the mayors hotline would have insight and information into the status of project such as this that so deeply affect the Boston community, can you give any sort of update as to when this nightmare made in?","requested_datetime":"2018-01-11T08:45:38-05:00","updated_datetime":"2018-01-11T08:45:00-05:00","address":"Intersection Of Ukraine Way & Washington St, Roslindale","lat":42.29849491889662,"long":-71.1157173837899},

{"service_request_id":"101002291116","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Thank you for raising this concern. In December 2017, the team performed a field check of these racks. The racks were first installed in 2014. While the angle and location of the racks does not meet our current guidance, we have found these to be acceptable. Two bikes can park at each rack without overhanging the curb. Please note that bikes should be locked either through the front or rear wheel + frame (not frame alone) to avoid overhang. It was further determined that the surface of the sidewalk would not allow easy relocation of the racks to further from the curb. Given that two bikes can use each rack and that the surface was not ideal for relocation, these racks will remain as is.","service_name":"Other","service_code":"4f38920fe75084437f0001a0","description":"These racks are angled so the bikes will be projected out into the street, that just seems wrong.
