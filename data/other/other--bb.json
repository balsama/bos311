Recently, it appears that the city added a few resident parking spots to the north side of east first street close to the intersection of Summer Street.  These spots now take up what was essentially a right turn lane and are cause incredible backups in the morning, much worse than when the trucks were coming from the Conley Terminal.  Our parking area is between 637 east first and 3 M street and we can now no longer turn left out of our driveway in the mornings.  So we turn right to go all the way around, and traffic is all the way back to the new Butler Massport Park.  It's suddenly worse than I have even seen it in 4 years in my building.  The problem is these 4 or 5 new resident parking spots.  Can you have a look at this during morning rush hour and please eliminate these new parking spots?","requested_datetime":"2017-12-19T08:28:33-05:00","updated_datetime":"2018-02-01T13:41:58-05:00","address":"Intersection Of Summer St & E First St, South Boston","lat":42.33817107311541,"long":-71.03514789261838,"media_url":"https://311.boston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/5a3913f604856fb8ba7b184e/report.jpg"},

The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) has identified the sinkhole as being the responsibility of Eversource Electric. During the normal construction season the permittee would be responsible to repair the bad patch within 2 weeks. However, since we are in the middle of Winter and conditions such as snow storms, temperatures below freezing, and asphalt plants being open only periodically the repair may have to wait longer than the typical 2 weeks. We will require the utility company to patch the settled area asap until a more permanent repair can be scheduled. The CIU has added the location to its data base that tracks unacceptable utility work. The CIU will monitor the progress of the work. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

He told me this morning that it backed up again on Friday which is why he went out there again. The police detail thought it was best to have the street closed.

I live on Tileston Street in the North End which is also directly outside of the small parking lot for the Eliot Upper School. Their trash was picked up at 4am this morning and 5am on Monday morning (Jan 22). Given the close quarters, the noise tends to echo causing a major disruption during the early hours of the morning ( garbage truck left running, dragging/banging barrels etc). Are there any rules or regulations that prevent trash pick up that early? If not, are there rules/regulations around a noise complaint? I don't mean to fuss but it's something I wanted to learn more about as its very disruptive during normal sleeping hours.
