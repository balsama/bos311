The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) looked into your complaints and determined the following:. The work in questions is National Grid repairing a Grade 2 gas leak. A permit was issued by the Public Works Department to perform the repair work. Construction work on residential streets in Boston is permitted to start at 7:00am. This is the standard starting time for construction work throughout Massachusetts. The times of work are determined by the Boston Transportation Department. If you have any issues with the times set you can call back the Mayors Hotline and they will transfer your case to BTD. The 100' is letting residents know that you cannot park within that 100\". The 100\" is how much room National Grid will need to maneuver their equipment and perform the work safely and properly. I did speak to National Grid regarding the posting dates, and they acknowledged that they should have been more accurate on the dates that they posted. In this case they are not working weekends and they should have only posted for the 24th and if they do not finish the job today, they would re post the 27th to complete the job. This would have made it clear that there was parking on the weekends. Hopefully the work can be done today. National Grid will  speak to their crews to make sure that they are positing no parking signs as accurately as possible when working in Boston. The City apologizes for the inconvenience of this necessary work. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.
