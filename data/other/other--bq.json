I asked that the city put in the iron covers (grates) , like there are on all the other trees on Summer Street, so that people could walk on the sidewalk and not be injured. Unfortunately the city removed the trees rather than put in well covers. My goal wasn't to have the trees removed, we need more trees in downtown Boston. But be that as it may. Now there are two empty trees pits and the color of the material in the pit is very like the color of the sidewalk so now many people are stepping into the tree pit and potentially hurting their ankles or knees. So can the city either put in new trees and use the iron covers to cover the tree wells, like the other trees on Summer St or fill in the tree pits so that people aren't potential hurting themselves.
