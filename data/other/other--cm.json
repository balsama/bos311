These druggies are having all their weirdo druggie friends sleeping here too and selling drugs from these apartments at all hours. Why are we letting drug addicts get elderly public housing apartments ahead of the elderly who these places were built for? Can't the city council have a hearing on this? The BHA won't answer my questions about this. It seems like the politicians are more interested I helping the druggies than the elderly.

{"service_request_id":"101001844296","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Noted. Thank you for contacting the Boston Transportation Department. We are constantly monitoring traffic along this corridor, which is caused by ongoing construction and general congestion. A seek alternate route sign would not help because most of the traffic is local (or continuing to the Arborway) and needs to use this route. Such a sign would encourage motorists to filter through side streets instead of staying on the main road. Rush hour is always a difficult time for traffic and is why we encourage alternative modes of transportation to keep cars off the road.","service_name":"Other","service_code":"4f38920fe75084437f0001a0","description":"This is the third time that I am writing about the horrible traffic on South Street in my neighborhood starting at the monument and going down to Forest Hills. A very simple solution would be to put up a sign by the monument letting people know they can seek an alternative route rather then continuing to sit in traffic and idle for hours. This is our neighborhood. I'm sure the levels of unacceptable pollution are so much higher and will continue because this is going on for another year.  I have posted this twice before including photos. I can include more photos but you can just drive down South Street in Jamaica Plain any day and see horrible traffic. I would love somebody to at least acknowledge this email. This seems like a very low budget solution to put up a sign. Even if one third of the people seek alternative routes that's less pollution and less traffic.

The city highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs. The city acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents,. However in the long run the construction is well worth it. Depending on the scope of work, part of or all of the street, may be posted at one time. We have instructed the contractor to only post the sections of the street that they will be working within the next 72  hours. This will allow more parking for the residents during construction. The CIU inspector will monitor the postings. For any questions, you can call the Inspector Joe Bocchetti at 781-603-7925. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

{"service_request_id":"101001843724","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. National Grid is installing a new gas main.  The city encourages this type of capital upgrade work.  It will provide dependable gas service to the residents as well as  eliminate future emergency repairs. The city acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents. However in the long run the placement of a new gas main is well worth it.  National Grid has to install the gas main first.  Once the main has been installed, then all service connections can be made.  If the city were to make National Grid pave to grade each day's trench work,  it would cause multiple seams along the trench. More importantly, every service connection needs to be cut into the trench.  If we were to pave the trench every day,  this would result in 2 by 2 patches inside the trench area, resulting in a very poor final product.  In order to have the best final paving, the city allows the utility company to leave the trench down low until all service connections are made and then pave the trench all at once, resulting in a smooth, level final trench repair. Service laterals are topped within 24 hours of excavation. What the constituent is observing is the trench left down low in preparation for one continuous final paving operation. We do require that the contractor place florescent orange signs ahead of the construction informing motorists that the trench ahead is down low. If you have any questions you can call the Inspector Joe Bocchetti  at 781-603-7925. For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

{"service_request_id":"101001548449","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Dear Constituent,. Before excavating in Massachusetts, its the law to call dig safe so that out all the underground utilities are marked out with paint. This allows the contractor to dig safely and not to hit an underground utility line such as the gas main. Its is rightfully so a mandatory requirement . The City does shares your frustration that after the work is complete the paint could be being viewed as graffiti by the public. We have reached out to the utility companies asking if they could develop a paint that wore off more quickly. Obviously the paint needs to stay visible while the work takes place. Because there is so much excavation going on in the City if we require a utility to power wash off a digsafe marking, we may be washing off new dig safe markings for another ticket called in for a  new excavation. This could cause a contractor to inadvertently hit an underground pipe and create a liability issue for the City. Its a dilemma that we are working on, its not an easy remedy .. however its important to remember that Public Safety trumps all. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli.

It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes.  The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride, the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of  the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt  that provides the smooth ride. The street is leafleted before the work begins where it explains that it is a mufti phase construction operation and you should look at the dates since they will change as each construction phases progresses.  Our goal is to allow parking between phases and not post the street for the entire time the work takes place. This is why the contractor repeatedly changes the dates. We spoke to the contractor about his need to be totally accurate when posting and leafleting  for upcoming work.
