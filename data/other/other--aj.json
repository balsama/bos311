The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector investigated and determined the following:. . The contractor is occupying the sidewalk while the new building is worked on. When a utility or contractor is working in Boston and the work is on the sidewalk they have two options regarding pedestrian notification. . They can create a temporary path of travel around the work zone, which means they will have to send pedestrians into the roadway, barricaded off, and two temporary asphalt ramps from the edgestone. . The other option which is mostly used, is to place sidewalk closed signs at the nearest crosswalks on either side of the construction. The signs tell the pedestrians to cross to the other side avoiding walking into the street. . Because of Boston's narrow streets and its limited parking it is very difficult to have temporary paths of travel.   The usual notification for pedestrians is to have sidewalk closed signs placed. .

The driver only stopped when neighbors came running over to complain. The owner of NRO (who had hired the truck) and a police officer were there for the incident. They clearly had tried to do the right thing by reserving the spaces but also greatly underestimated the size of the truck and its ability to fit on this small residential street. Trees are so important in an urban setting and Beacon Hill has been working hard to both protect those that we still have and to plant/grow new ones where others have died, which has proven slow, costly and difficult.

{"service_request_id":"101002493705","status":"closed","status_notes":"Case Resolved. Gail,. As I stated over the phone with you,  Mayor Walsh and Boston Public Works Department realizes how important it is to maintain the street condition of Blue Hill Ave. Not only is it one of our most important streets, it is a major gateway in and out of the City. However we do not want to invest City money to pave a street if we know a utility or private contractor will be digging it in the near future. As you know, there is so much work going on in the City. That?s why in 2010 the Public Works Department created online reservation software called The City of Boston Coordination Software (COBUCS). Before receiving a permit, every utility company, private contractor, site plan engineer, City Departments, and Public Works paving projects all have to enter their work into the COBUCS system. The COBUCS system will alert the City and permittees of potential conflicts this will allow coordination to take place that wasn't done as successful before COBUCS. Since 2010 COBUCS has alerted the City of over 12,000 conflicts at a savings of over $40 million dollars of unnecessary paving fees if the street was cut after it was completed. No Street will be paved unless officially cleared through the COBUCS system. Boston is one of the few City's in the entire country that you cannot get a permit without entering the job into our online software. Unfortunately Blue Hill Ave has major conflicts. However, if the conflict is a new pipe or conduit which is a case on a lot of the Blue Hill Ave  proposed utility work then the City is getting what it should get from the utility,  full replacement of an old main or conduit. This not only gives the neighborhood superior utility services, but it also eliminates emergency repairs after we pave.  We are working with the utility companies to try to push their work up this year and next. Our goal is to try to pave Grove Hall this Fall or at the latest next Spring. Please reach out to my office and we can go over the proposed paving limits on Blue Hill Ave as well as the major utility conflicts. In the meantime I will have our CIU Inspectors drive all of Blue Hill Ave and make sure any substandard utility cut or casting is repaired to grade. . For any questions or concerns, please contact the number listed below. Sincerely,. Mark Cardarelli. Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance.

The windows are terribly old and do not work properly. Some don't work at all. Others won't stay up & slam shut at a speed that could snap a small child's finger in half. In the warmer months there are days that the 2nd floor classrooms can reach a temp of 85 degrees with windows that can't stay opened. The teachers bring box fans from home. As a tax payer and 42 year resident of West Roxbury I don't understand how this isn't addressed or why we don't have the highest quality school buildings in the State. Biggest housing boom & tax base increase in the cities history & we don't have windows that work in a public school for kids ages 4-9? This is unacceptable & likely the tip of the iceberg citywide. It appears are Mayor travels the country in support of other unions and candidates, is even ready to spend 92 mil on a bridge in Quincy? How about focusing on our kids/schools as a priority.
