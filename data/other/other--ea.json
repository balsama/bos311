This puts them in direct conflict with a pedestrian walk signal, and puts pedestrians at this crossing in danger. Every day when I cross at this point, I see at least one car that fails to come to a stop entirely, or that stops well into the crosswalk only upon sighting a pedestrian at the last minute. I also regularly see drivers making the right turn without looking to their right to check for pedestrians crossing toward the Landmark Center. Any seasoned walker in Boston will know that the only way to survive in this city is to regard vehicular traffic with total suspicion--but all it will take is one tired, inattentive, distracted, or out-of-town pedestrian and one tired, inattentive, distracted, or out-of-town driver failing to read each other's intent at the same time for there to be a very serious accident here. Given the rampant levels of texting while driving that I see as a pedestrian, I think it can't be long before those conditions coincide.\r\n\r\nPLEASE have a traffic safety expert come to this intersection SOON to observe what is currently happening here, and develop a plan. At bare minimum it would seem that there needs to be a NO TURN ON RIGHT sign placed in this intersection. If this really is a designated pedestrian crossing, such a sign should be a no-brainer. If the city is unwilling to install such a sign because it does not want to interfere with vehicular traffic, then to be honest and consistent it should remove the crosswalk and signals, and indicate that this is a dangerous situation by placing a NO PEDESTRIAN CROSSING SIGN at relevant points.","requested_datetime":"2014-03-11T07:59:26-04:00","updated_datetime":"2014-03-11T07:59:25-04:00","address":"1-23 Pilgrim Road, Boston","lat":42.343116374679866,"long":-71.10455160617067},
