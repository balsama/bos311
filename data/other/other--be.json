My concern is with the NUMEROUS private shuttle buses, evidentially contracted by companies in advance he South Station area, who illegally \"live\" park along Causeway Street during the AM commuting hour.  They block cross walks, and disability ramps. Most don't even bother to park close along the sidewalks and are often several feet out in the street.  This makes is extremely difficult for us walkers to maneuver the crosswalks.  I often have to step around a shuttle; mid the cross walk and have had a number of close calls.... even as early as 6am!
