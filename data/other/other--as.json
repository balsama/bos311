We called the contractor who apologized and thought the permit expired July 15th. That's still not an excusable explanation. They agreed to take the signs down asap and apply for an extension and then repost. The good news is that you will notice the patch repairs are left in excellent condition. It is an important City service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes. . Below is the steps taken to do the permanent repair. . The construction process is to dig out 6.5 to 7.5\" inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride. The contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride. We apologize for the inconvenience. .

Signs clearly state no turn from 4-6 pm on weekdays and police have only been here a handful of times to enforce this. The people using this street to cut through have no regard for residents trying to parallel park, gather groceries, or get children out of the backseat. on the nicer end of things we are viciously beeped at or almost rear ended but usually it's a middle finger and almost hit by these vehicles on a daily basis. Im sure the majority do not even notice the no left turn sign so posting a speed limit sign will most likely go unnoticed. I'm just tired of being looked at as an inconvenience to non residents. Maybe having the police here during the posted times may cause an indent in the issue but something needs to happen before someone is seriously injured.","requested_datetime":"2018-06-23T10:36:25-04:00","updated_datetime":"2018-06-23T10:36:00-04:00","address":"36 Buttonwood St, 1, Dorchester","lat":42.32052214447626,"long":-71.05606164789856},

If the asphalt patch does not meet our standards they will need to repair the asphalt ASAP until the permanent restoration is scheduled. . The CIU will monitor the progress of the repair. .
